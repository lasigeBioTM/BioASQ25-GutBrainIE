<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Making Sense of … the Microbiome in Psychiatry. Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the <e1>@anatomical location$ brain.@/anatomical location$</e1> Several modes of interaction between the gut and the <e2>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e2> have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the <e3>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve,@/anatomical location$</e3>  and activation of the <e4>@anatomical location$ immune system.@/anatomical location$</e4>  A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and <e5>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders.@/DDF$</e5>  These include <e6>@DDF$ mood @/DDF$</e6> and <e7>@DDF$ anxiety disorders,@/DDF$</e7>  neurodevelopmental disorders such as <e8>@DDF$ autism spectrum disorder @/DDF$</e8> and <e9>@DDF$ schizophrenia,@/DDF$</e9>  and even <e10>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e10> such as <e11>@DDF$ Alzheimer's @/DDF$</e11> and <e12>@DDF$ Parkinson's diseases.@/DDF$</e12>  Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome.Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive <e13>@DDF$ decline,@/DDF$</e13>  and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Alteration of Gut Microbiome in Patients With <e1>@DDF$ Schizophrenia @/DDF$</e1> Indicates Links Between Bacterial Tyrosine Biosynthesis and Cognitive Dysfunction. Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous <e2>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorder @/DDF$</e2> for which current treatment has insufficient efficacy and severe adverse effects. The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis. In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument. SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing <e3>@chemical$ tyrosine,@/chemical$</e3>  a precursor for <e4>@chemical$ dopamine,@/chemical$</e4>  was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (ρ = 0.34, <i>q</i> ≤ .1). Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome. Cognitive function of patients with SCZ is associated with the potential for gut bacterial biosynthesis of tyrosine, a precursor for <e5>@chemical$ dopamine,@/chemical$</e5>  suggesting that gut microbiota might be an intervention target for alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in <e6>@DDF$ SCZ.@/DDF$</e6>

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",

            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations

<e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> microbiome and magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of subjects at ultra-high risk for <e2>@DDF$ psychosis @/DDF$</e2> may support the membrane hypothesis. The microbiota-<e3>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e3> axis and membrane dysfunction in the <e4>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e4> has attracted increasing attention in the field of psychiatric research. However, the possible interactive role of <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> microbiota and <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet. To explore this, we collected <e7>@anatomical location$ fecal samples @/anatomical location$</e7> and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC). Then we analyzed the differences in <e8>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e8> microbiota and <e9>@chemical$ choline @/chemical$</e9> concentrations in the <e10>@anatomical location$ anterior cingulate cortex @/anatomical location$</e10> (<e11>@anatomical location$ ACC)@/anatomical location$</e11> . Presences of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales were observed at increase levels in <e12>@anatomical location$ fecal samples @/anatomical location$</e12> of <e13>@DDF$ UHR @/DDF$</e13> subjects compared to the other two groups. The composition changes of <e14>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e14> microbiota indicate the increased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (<e15>@chemical$ SCFAs)@/chemical$</e15> , which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of <e16>@chemical$ choline @/chemical$</e16> levels, a <e17>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e17> imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups. Both <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> microbiome and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the <e19>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e19> and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of <e20>@DDF$ schizophrenia.@/DDF$</e20>

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal
2. Bacteria -> part of -> Microbiome
3. Chemical -> located in -> [Anatomical Loc., Human, Animal]
4. Chemical -> interact -> Chemical

6. Chemical -> impact -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
7. Chemical -> produced by -> Microbiome
8. Chemical -> influence -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
9. Chemical -> change expression -> Gene
10. Dietary Supplement -> impact -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
11. Dietary Supplement -> influence -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
12. Dietary Supplement -> change expression -> Gene
13. Drug -> impact -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
14. Drug -> change expression -> Gene
15. Drug -> interact -> [Chemical, Drug]
16. Drug -> change effect -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
17. Food -> impact -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
18. Food -> influence -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
19. Food -> change expression -> Gene
20. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> strike -> Anatomical Location
21. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> change abundance -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
22. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> interact -> Chemical
23. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> affect -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
24. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> is a -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
25. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> target -> [Human, Animal]
26. Human -> used by -> Biomedical Technique
27. Animal -> used by -> Biomedical Technique
28. Microbiome -> located in -> [Anatomical Loc., Human, Animal]
29. Microbiome -> change expression -> Gene
30. Microbiome -> is linked to -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
31. Microbiome -> compared to -> Microbiome

The functional roles of short chain fatty acids as postbiotics in human <e1>@anatomical location$ gut:@/anatomical location$</e1>  future perspectives. The significance of <e2>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e2> microbiome and their metabolites (postbiotics) on <e3>@human$ human @/human$</e3> health could be a promising approach to treat various diseases that includes <e4>@DDF$ inflammatory bowel diseases,@/DDF$</e4>  <e5>@DDF$ colon cancer,@/DDF$</e5>  and many <e6>@anatomical location$ neurological @/anatomical location$</e6> disorders. Probiotics with potential mental health benefits (psychobiotics) can alter the <e7>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e7> axis via immunological, humoral, neuronal, and metabolic pathways. Recently, probiotic bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> have been demonstrated for <e8>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e8> production, which play a crucial role in a variety of diseases. These acids could enhance the production of mucins, antimicrobial proteins (bacteriocins and peptides), <e9>@gene$ cytokines @/gene$</e9> (<e10>@gene$ Interleukin 10 and 18)@/gene$</e10>  and neurotransmitters (<e11>@chemical$ serotonin)@/chemical$</e11>  in the <e12>@anatomical location$ intestine @/anatomical location$</e12> to main the <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> microbiota, <e14>@anatomical location$ intestinal barrier system @/anatomical location$</e14> and other <e15>@anatomical location$ immune @/anatomical location$</e15> functions. In this review, we discuss about two mechanisms such as (i) <e16>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e16> mediated <e17>@anatomical location$ intestinal barrier @/anatomical location$</e17> system, and (ii) SCF<e18>@chemical$ As @/chemical$</e18> mediated <e19>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e19> axis to elucidate the therapeutic options for the treatment/prevention of various diseases.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal

Metformin acts on the gut-brain axis to ameliorate antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction. Antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction (<e1>@DDF$ AIMD)@/DDF$</e1>  is an intractable clinical challenge worldwide. The situation is becoming more critical as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), to a great extent, have replaced the role of first-generation antipsychotics in managing major psychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms for developing AIMD is intricate, emerging evidence has indicated the involvement of the microbiota-<e2>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e2> axis in AIMD. SGAs treatment may change the diversity and compositions of <e3>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e3> flora (e.g., decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased Firmicutes). Short-chain <e4>@chemical$ fatty acids @/chemical$</e4> and other metabolites derived from gut microbiota, on the one hand, can regulate the activity of <e5>@anatomical location$ intestinal endocrine @/anatomical location$</e5> cells and their secretion of satiety hormones (e.g., <e6>@gene$ glucagon-like peptide 1,@/gene$</e6>  <e7>@gene$ peptide YY,@/gene$</e7>  <e8>@gene$ cholecystokinin @/gene$</e8> and <e9>@gene$ ghrelin)@/gene$</e9> ; on the other hand, can activate the <e10>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e10> or transport into the <e11>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e11> to exert a central modulation of foraging behaviors via binding to <e12>@gene$ neuropeptide receptors.@/gene$</e12>  Interestingly, metformin, a classical antidiabetic agent, is capable of alleviating <e13>@DDF$ AIMD @/DDF$</e13> possibly by regulating the microbiota-<e14>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e14> axis. That is, <e15>@drug$ metformin @/drug$</e15> can not only partially reverse the alterations of gut microbial communities due to SGAs treatment, but also play a positive role in rectifying the disturbances of peripheral and central satiety-related neuropeptides. Current evidence has indicated a promising role for <e16>@drug$ metformin @/drug$</e16> on ameliorating AMID, but further verifications in well-designed clinical trials are still warranted.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Combination of <e1>@chemical$ vitamin D<sub>3</sub> @/chemical$</e1> and fructooligosaccharides upregulates <e2>@anatomical location$ colonic @/anatomical location$</e2> vitamin D receptor in C57BL/6J mice and affects <e3>@DDF$ anxiety-@/DDF$</e3> related behavior in a sex-specific manner. Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders that affect US adults today, frequently related to vitamin D (VD) insufficiency. Along with VD, growing evidence suggests gut microbiota likely play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated if modulation of gut microbiota would disrupt host VD status and promote behaviors related to depression and anxiety in adult mice. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10/mice/group) were randomly assigned to receive (1) control diet (CTR), control diet treated with antibiotics (AB), control diet with total 5000 IU of VD (VD), VD treated with antibiotics (VD + AB), VD supplemented with 5% w/w fructooligosaccharides (FOS; VF), and VF diet treated with antibiotics (VF + AB), respectively, for 8 weeks. Our study demonstrated that VD status was not affected by antibiotic regimen. VD alone ameliorates anxiety-related behavior in female mice, and that combination with FOS (i.e., VF) did not further improve the outcome. Male mice, in contrast, exhibit greater anxiety with VF, but not VD, when compared with CTR mice. Colonic <e4>@gene$ VD receptor @/gene$</e4> was elevated in VF-treated mice in both sexes, compared with CTR, which was positively correlated to colonic <e5>@gene$ TPH1,@/gene$</e5>  a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of VF on anxiety-related behavior is sex-specific, which may partially be attributed to the activation of <e6>@anatomical location$ colonic @/anatomical location$</e6> VD signaling and subsequent <e7>@chemical$ serotonin @/chemical$</e7> synthesis. The synergistic or additive effect of VD and FOS on <e8>@DDF$ mood disorders @/DDF$</e8> remained to be investigated.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Impact of prebiotics on metabolic and behavioral alterations in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome. Mounting evidence shows that the gut microbiota, an important player within the gut-brain communication axis, can affect metabolism, inflammation, brain function and behavior. Interestingly, gut microbiota composition is known to be altered in patients with metabolic syndrome (<e1>@DDF$ MetS)@/DDF$</e1> , who also often display <e2>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric symptoms.@/DDF$</e2>  The use of prebiotics, which beneficially alters the microbiota, may therefore be a promising way to potentially improve physical and mental health in <e3>@DDF$ MetS @/DDF$</e3> patients. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of MetS, namely the obese and type-2 diabetic db/db mice, which display emotional and cognitive alterations associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and hippocampal inflammation compared to their lean db/+ littermates. We assessed the impact of chronic administration (8weeks) of prebiotics (oligofructose) on both metabolic (body weight, food intake, glucose homeostasis) and behavioral (increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial memory) alterations characterizing db/db mice, as well as related neurobiological correlates, with particular attention to neuroinflammatory processes. Prebiotic administration improved excessive food intake and glycemic dysregulations (glucose tolerance and insulin resistance) in db/db mice. This was accompanied by an increase of plasma anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels and <e4>@anatomical location$ hypothalamic @/anatomical location$</e4> mRNA expression of the anorexigenic cytokine <e5>@gene$ IL-1β,@/gene$</e5>  whereas unbalanced mRNA expression of <e6>@anatomical location$ hypothalamic @/anatomical location$</e6> orexigenic (<e7>@gene$ NPY)@/gene$</e7>  and anorexigenic (<e8>@gene$ CART,@/gene$</e8>  <e9>@gene$ POMC)@/gene$</e9>  peptides was unchanged. We also detected signs of improved <e10>@anatomical location$ blood-brain-barrier @/anatomical location$</e10> integrity in the <e11>@anatomical location$ hypothalamus @/anatomical location$</e11> of <e12>@chemical$ oligofructose-@/chemical$</e12> treated db/db mice (normalized expression of tight junction proteins <e13>@gene$ ZO-1 @/gene$</e13> and <e14>@gene$ occludin)@/gene$</e14> . On the contrary, prebiotic administration did not improve behavioral alterations and associated reduction of <e15>@anatomical location$ hippocampal @/anatomical location$</e15> neurogenesis displayed by db/db mice, despite normalization of increased <e16>@anatomical location$ hippocampal @/anatomical location$</e16> <e17>@gene$ IL-6 @/gene$</e17> mRNA expression. Of note, we found a relationship between the effect of treatment on <e18>@anatomical location$ dentate gyrus @/anatomical location$</e18> neurons and spatial memory. These findings may prove valuable for introducing novel approaches to treat some of the comorbidities associated with MetS.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal
2. Bacteria -> part of -> Microbiome

HFE Genotype Restricts the Response to Paraquat in a Mouse Model of Neurotoxicity. Parkinson's disease is marked clinically by motor dysfunction and pathologically by dopaminergic cell loss in the <e1>@anatomical location$ substantia nigra @/anatomical location$</e1> and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. The driver underlying iron accumulation remains unknown and could be genetic or environmental. The HFE protein is critical for the regulation of cellular iron uptake. Mutations within this protein are associated with increased iron accumulation including in the brain. We have focused on the commonly occurring H63D variant of the HFE gene as a disease modifier <e5>@chemical$ in a @/chemical$</e5> number of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the role of H63D HFE genotype, we generated a mouse model in which the wild-type (WT) HFE gene is replaced by the H67D gene variant (mouse homolog of the human H63D gene variant). Using paraquat toxicity as the model for Parkinson's disease, we found that WT mice responded as expected with sig<e12>@DDF$ nificantly greater<e15>@gene$  mot@/gene$</e15> or fu@/DDF$</e12> nction, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase staining and increase microglial staining in the substantia nigra, a<e17>@gene$ nd an inc@/gene$</e17> rease in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rate within the substantia nigra of the paraquat-treated m<e19>@gene$ i<e1@/gene$</e19> 8>@gene$ ce co@/gene$</e18> mpared to their saline-tr<e13>@DDF$ eated<e20>@gene$  coun@/gene$</e20> terparts. @/DDF$</e13> In contrast, the H67D mice showed a remarkable resistance to paraq<e6>@chemical$ uat treat@/chemical$</e6> ment; specifically differing from the WT mice with no changes in motor function or changes in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation ra<e7>@chemical$ tes follo@/chemical$</e7> wing paraquat exposure. At baseline, there were differences between the H67D HFE mice and WT mice in gut microbiome profile and increased L-<e8>@chemical$ ferritin @/chemical$</e8> stainin<e3>@anatomical location$ g in@/anatomical location$</e3>  the <e2>@anatomical location$ su<e4>@gene$ bstantia ni@/gene$</e4> gra @/anatomical location$</e2> that could account for the resistance to paraquat. Of particular note, the H67D HFE mice regardless of whether or not they were treated with <e9>@chemical$ paraquat @/chemical$</e9> had significantly less tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining than WT. Our results clearly demonstrate that the HFE genotype impacts the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, the gut microbiome and the response to <e10>@chemical$ paraquat @/chemical$</e10> providing additional support that the HFE genotype is a disease modifier for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the <e14>@DDF$ finding that the HFE@/DDF$</e14>  mutant mice are resistant to <e<e16>@gene$ 11>@@/gene$</e16> chemical$ paraquat @/chemical$</e11> may provide a model in which to study resistant mechanisms to neurotoxicants.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

<e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> instincts in neuroimmunity from the eighteenth to twenty-first centuries. In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-<e2>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e2> axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between <e3>@anatomical location$ body systems @/anatomical location$</e3> in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with <e4>@DDF$ non-communicable chronic diseases @/DDF$</e4> whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> or <e6>@anatomical location$ brain,@/anatomical location$</e6>  such as <e7>@DDF$ inflammatory bowel disease,@/DDF$</e7>  <e8>@DDF$ irritable bowel syndrome,@/DDF$</e8>  <e9>@DDF$ Parkinson's @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease,@/DDF$</e10>  and <e11>@DDF$ autism spectrum disorder.@/DDF$</e11>  However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the <e12>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e12> microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> microbiota, the <e14>@anatomical location$ immune system,@/anatomical location$</e14>  and the <e15>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e15> in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of <e16>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e16> interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of <e17>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e17> axis research, focusing on <e18>@anatomical location$ neuro-immune-@/anatomical location$</e18> microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-<e19>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e19> research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the <e20>@anatomical location$ brain.@/anatomical location$</e20>

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Enriched Environmental Conditions Modify the <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbiome Composition and <e2>@anatomical location$ Fecal @/anatomical location$</e2> Markers of <e3>@DDF$ Inflammation @/DDF$</e3> in <e4>@DDF$ Parkinson's Disease.@/DDF$</e4>  Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, <e5>@anatomical location$ head @/anatomical location$</e5> injury, <e6>@chemical$ nicotine,@/chemical$</e6>  and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human <e7>@gene$ SNCA @/gene$</e7> gene (<e8>@gene$ SNCA-@/gene$</e8> TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of <e9>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e9> to study whether environmental conditions such as standard <i>vs.</i> enriched environment changes the <e10>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e10> microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on <e11>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e11> samples for microbiome analysis and studied <e12>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e12> inflammatory <e13>@gene$ calpr@/gene$</e13> otectin from the <e14>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e14> of control and <e15>@gene$ SNC@/gene$</e15> A-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the <e16>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e16> microbiota was not changed in <e17>@gene$ SNCA-@/gene$</e17> TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> bacteria at genus level such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. was a significant changed in the <e19>@gene$ SNCA-@/gene$</e19> TG mice. EE significantly reduced <e20>@anatomical location$ colon fecal @/anatomical location$</e20> inflammatory <e21>@gene$ calprotectin @/gene$</e21> protein in WT and <e22>@gene$ SNCA-@/gene$</e22> TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory <e23>@gene$ cytokines @/gene$</e23> in the <e24>@anatomical location$ feces @/anatomical location$</e24> and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

The <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and <e2>@DDF$ Trauma-Related Disorders.@/DDF$</e2>  Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of <e3>@DDF$ anxiety- @/DDF$</e3> and <e4>@DDF$ trauma-related disorders.@/DDF$</e4>  This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the <e7>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e7> microbiome in <e8>@DDF$ anxiety- @/DDF$</e8> and <e9>@DDF$ trauma-related disorders.@/DDF$</e9>  The microbiota-<e10>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e10> (<e11>@anatomical location$ MGB)@/anatomical location$</e11>  axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the <e12>@anatomical location$ hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal @/anatomical location$</e12> (<e13>@anatomical location$ HPA) axis @/anatomical location$</e13> early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in <e14>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders,@/DDF$</e14>  focusing on <e15>@DDF$ anxiety- @/DDF$</e15> and <e16>@DDF$ trauma-related disorders @/DDF$</e16> specifically, and discuss the <e17>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e17> microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the <e19>@anatomical location$ MGB@/anatomical location$</e19> . In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and <e20>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e20> microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in <e21>@DDF$ mental illness @/DDF$</e21> and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"

Health relevance of the modification of low grade inflammation in ageing (inflammageing) and the role of nutrition. Ageing of the global population has become a public health concern with an important socio-economic dimension. Ageing is characterized by an increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that has been termed "inflammageing". The inflammatory response is beneficial as an acute, transient reaction to harmful conditions, facilitating the defense, repair, turnover and adaptation of many tissues. However, chronic and low grade inflammation is likely to be detrimental for many <e1>@anatomical location$ tissues @/anatomical location$</e1> and for normal functions. We provide an overview of low grade inflammation (LGI) and determine the potential drivers and the effects of the "inflamed" phenotype observed in the elderly. We discuss the role of <e2>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e2> microbiota and <e3>@anatomical location$ immune system @/anatomical location$</e3> crosstalk and the <e4>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e4> axis. Then, we focus on major health complications associated with LGI in the elderly, including mental health and wellbeing, metabolic <e5>@DDF$ abnormalities @/DDF$</e5> and <e6>@DDF$ infections.@/DDF$</e6>  Finally, we discuss the possibility of manipulating <e7>@DDF$ LGI @/DDF$</e7> in the elderly by nutritional interventions. We provide an overview of the evidence that exists in the elderly for <e8>@chemical$ omega-3 fatty acid,@/chemical$</e8>  probiotic, prebiotic, antioxidant and <e9>@chemical$ polyphenol @/chemical$</e9> interventions as a means to influence LGI. We conclude that slowing, controlling or reversing <e10>@DDF$ LGI @/DDF$</e10> is likely to be an important way to prevent, or reduce the severity of, age-related functional decline and the onset of conditions affecting health and well-being; that there is evidence to support specific dietary interventions as a strategy to control <e11>@DDF$ LGI;@/DDF$</e11>  and that a continued research focus on this field is warranted.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON

Unveiling of dietary and <e1>@anatomical location$ gut-@/anatomical location$</e1> microbiota derived <e2>@chemical$ B vitamins:@/chemical$</e2>  Metabolism patterns and their synergistic functions in <e3>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e3> homeostasis. Nutrition-<e4>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e4> cross-talk holds a vital position in sustaining <e5>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e5> function, and micronutrient metabolism has emerged as the foremost metabolic pathway to preserve <e6>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e6> homeostasis. Among micronutrients, <e7>@chemical$ B vitamins @/chemical$</e7> have evolved prior to DNA/RNA and are known for their vital roles for major evolutionary transitions in extant organisms. Despite their universal requirement and critical role, not all the three domains of life are endowed with a natural ability for <i>de novo</i> B vitamins synthesis. The human <e8>@anatomical location$ gut microbiome @/anatomical location$</e8> constitutes prototrophs and auxotroph which are entirely dependent on dietary intake and <e9>@anatomical location$ gut microbial @/anatomical location$</e9> production of <e10>@chemical$ B vitamins.@/chemical$</e10>  The syntrophic metabolism involving cross-feeding of B vitamins and community-wide exchange between commensal bacteria elicit important changes in the diversity and composition of the human <e11>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e11> microbiome. Hereto, we discuss the <e12>@chemical$ B-vitamins @/chemical$</e12> sharing among prototrophic and auxotrophic <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> bacteria, their absorption in <e14>@anatomical location$ small intestine @/anatomical location$</e14> and transport in <e15>@anatomical location$ distal gut,@/anatomical location$</e15>  functional role in relation to the <e16>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e16> homeostasis and symptoms linked to their deficiency. We also briefly explore their potential involvement as psychobiotics in <e17>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e17> energetic metabolism (<e18>@chemical$ kynurenines/tryptophan @/chemical$</e18> pathway) for <e19>@anatomical location$ neurological @/anatomical location$</e19> functions and highlight their deficiency related malfunctioning.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

The Role of the Oral Microbiota Related to <e1>@anatomical location$ Periodontal @/anatomical location$</e1> Diseases in Anxiety, Mood and Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders. The prevalence of anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders are on the rise; however, efforts to develop new and effective treatment strategies have had limited success. To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the <e2>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e2> microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the <e3>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e3> microbiota are limited. The <e4>@anatomical location$ oral cavity @/anatomical location$</e4> houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the <e5>@anatomical location$ soft and hard tissues.@/anatomical location$</e5>  <e6>@anatomical location$ Periodontal @/anatomical location$</e6> diseases encompass a group of <e7>@DDF$ infectious and inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e7> that affect the <e8>@anatomical location$ periodontium.@/anatomical location$</e8>  Among them, <e9>@DDF$ periodontitis @/DDF$</e9> is defined as a <e10>@DDF$ chronic, multi-bacterial infection @/DDF$</e10> that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation <i>via</i> the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of <e11>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e11> pathogens. <e12>@DDF$ Periodontitis @/DDF$</e12> can also induce or exacerbate other <e13>@DDF$ chronic systemic inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e13> such as <e14>@DDF$ atherosclerosis @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ diabetes @/DDF$</e15> and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of <e16>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e16> (such as <e17>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e17> and <e18>@DDF$ schizophrenia)@/DDF$</e18> , especially as dysregulation of the <e19>@anatomical location$ immune system @/anatomical location$</e19> also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the <e20>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e20> microbiota associated with <e21>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e21> diseases in <e22>@DDF$ anxiety,@/DDF$</e22>  mood and <e23>@DDF$ trauma- @/DDF$</e23> and <e24>@DDF$ stress-related disorders.@/DDF$</e24>  Epidemiological data of <e25>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e25> diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the <e26>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e26> microbiota and the <e27>@anatomical location$ central nervous system.@/anatomical location$</e27>  Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the <e28>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e28> microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON

Jianpi Jieyu Decoction, An Empirical Herbal Formula, Exerts Psychotropic Effects in Association With Modulation of <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbial Diversity and <e2>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e2> Activity. <b>Background:</b> Recent studies suggest that <e3>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e3> microbiota was associated with the bidirectional <e4>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e4> axis which could modulate neuropsychological functions of the <e5>@anatomical location$ central nervous system.@/anatomical location$</e5>  <e6>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e6> microbiota could produce <e7>@chemical$ gamma aminobutyric acid @/chemical$</e7> (<e8>@chemical$ GABA)@/chemical$</e8>  that could modulate the <e9>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e9> axis response<i>.</i> Jianpi Jieyu (JPJY) decoction, a traditional Chinese formula, is mainly composed of <i>Astragalus membranaxeus</i> and Radix <i>Pseudostellariae</i>. Although the JPJY decoction has been used to treat the <e10>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e10> in China, the potential action of its antidepressant has not been well understood. Thus this study was aim to investigate the role of JPJY improve <e11>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e11> microbiota homeostasis in the chronic stress induced <e12>@DDF$ depressive @/DDF$</e12> mice. <b>Methods:</b> The antidepressant effect of JPJY on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice was evaluated by using <e13>@chemical$ sucrose @/chemical$</e13> preference test, <e14>@anatomical location$ tail @/anatomical location$</e14> suspension test and forced swim test. <e15>@DDF$ Fatigue-@/DDF$</e15> like behaviors were evaluated using degree of redness, grip strength test, and exhaustive swimming test. The new object recognition test was used to evaluate cognition performance. <e16>@anatomical location$ Fecal samples @/anatomical location$</e16> were collected and taxonomical analysis of <e17>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e17> microbial distribution was conducted with 16S rDNA. <e18>@anatomical location$ Serum @/anatomical location$</e18> level of <e19>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e19> was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of <e20>@gene$ GluR1 @/gene$</e20> and p-Tau protein in the hippocampus was determined using Western blotting. <b>Results:</b> The dose of 9.2 g/kg JPJY produced antidepressant-like effects. JPJY and its major components also modulated gut microbiota diversity in the CUMS mice. Serum level of GABA and the expressions of hippocampal GluR1 and p-Tau were reversed after the administration of JPJY in CUMS mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> JPJY regulates gut microbiota to produce antidepressant-like effect and improve cognition deficit in depressive mice while its molecular mechanism possibly be enhanced NR1 and Tau expression in hippocampus and increased GABA in serum.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",

Proton Pump Inhibitor Use, <e1>@DDF$ Fatigue,@/DDF$</e1>  and Health-Related Quality of Life in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Results From the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study. Prior studies report that the use of <e2>@gene$ proton pump @/gene$</e2> inhibitors (<e3>@drug$ PPIs)@/drug$</e3>  can adversely affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal uptake of micronutrients, in particular iron and magnesium, and are used frequently by <e4>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e4> transplant recipients. Altered <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> microbiota, iron deficiency, and magnesium deficiency have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <e6>@DDF$ chronic fatigue.@/DDF$</e6>  Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of <e7>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e7> and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population. Cross-sectional study. <e8>@anatomical location$ Kidney @/anatomical location$</e8> transplant recipients (≥1 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study. PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use. <e9>@DDF$ Fatigue @/DDF$</e9> and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire. Logistic and linear regression. We included 937 <e10>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e10> transplant recipients (mean age 56±13 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. <e11>@drug$ PPI @/drug$</e11> use was associated with <e12>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e12> severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe <e13>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e13> (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI, -11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI, -7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of <e14>@anatomical location$ upper gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e14> disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with <e15>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e15> severity. Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships. <e16>@drug$ PPI @/drug$</e16> use is independently associated with <e17>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e17> and lower HRQoL among <e18>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e18> transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating <e19>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e19> and improving HRQoL among <e20>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e20> transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted. In this observational study, we investigated the association of <e21>@gene$ proton pump @/gene$</e21> inhibitors with <e22>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e22> and health-related quality of life among <e23>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e23> transplant recipients. Our data showed that <e24>@gene$ proton @/gene$</e24> pump inhibitors were independently associated with <e25>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e25> severity, severe <e26>@DDF$ fatigue,@/DDF$</e26>  and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed <e27>@gene$ proton pump @/gene$</e27> inhibitor types and were dose dependent. While we await future studies on this topic, <e28>@gene$ proton pump @/gene$</e28> inhibitor use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating <e29>@DDF$ fatigue @/DDF$</e29> and improving health-related quality of life among <e30>@anatomical location$ kidney @/anatomical location$</e30> transplant recipients.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Nourishing the brain on deep space missions: nutritional psychiatry in promoting resilience. The grueling psychological demands of a journey into deep space coupled with ever-increasing distances away from home pose a unique problem: how can we best take advantage of the benefits of fresh foods in a place that has none? Here, we consider the biggest challenges associated with our current spaceflight food system, highlight the importance of supporting optimal brain health on missions into deep space, and discuss evidence about food components that impact brain health. We propose a future food system that leverages the <e1>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e1> microbiota that can be individually tailored to best support the <e2>@DDF$ brain @/DDF$</e2> and mental health of crews on deep space long-duration missions. Working toward this goal, we will also be making investments in sustainable means to nourish the crew that remains here on spaceship Earth.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Human <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbiome Response to Short-Term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-Based Probiotic Treatment. Gut microbiota is believed to play a crucial role in modulating obesity in humans, and probiotics affecting gut microbiota can alleviate some of the obesity-related health complications. The study was aimed to investigate changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in obese humans due to short-term (2 weeks) tr<e7>@DDF$ eatment @/DDF$</e7> of obese patients with a probiotic preparation containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>. <e2>@anatomical location$ Faecal  <e10>@DDF$@/anat<e@/DDF$</e10> 6>@anatomical location$ omic@/anatomical location$</e6> al location$</<e8>@DDF$ e2> mi@/DDF$</e8> crobiome diversity was studied using the 16S amp<e9>@DDF$ licon @/DDF$</e9> sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed distribution across 14 phyla (with <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> dominating), 21 class, 125 genera and 973 OTUs. The probiotic treatment decreased relative abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (<i>Prevotellaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>), while increasing that of <i>Actinobacteria</i> (<i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i>), and <i>Firmicutes</i> (<i>Negativicutes</i>: <i>Veillonellaceae</i> and <i>Clostridia</i>: <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>). The probiotic treatment decreased total <e3>@anatomical location$ blood @/anatomical location$</e3> <e4>@chemical$ sugar @/chemical$</e4> and increased patients' assessment of their physical and mental health. Thus even the short-term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-based probiotic treatment brought significant compositional changes in the 16S rRNA gene diversity in <e5>@anatomical location$ faecal @/anatomical location$</e5> bacterial assemblages by increasing beneficial and decreasing pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria; the related shifts in life quality assessment necessitate further research into the causal relationships involved.

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Long-Term Use of Antibiotics and Risk of <e1>@DDF$ Parkinson's Disease @/DDF$</e1> in the Nurses' Health Study. Antibiotic use is one of the strongest environmental predictors of an altered and less diverse <e2>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e2> microbiome, which has been linked to <e3>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease.@/DDF$</e3>  To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the association between long-term antibiotic use and <e4>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease.@/DDF$</e4>  We conducted a prospective study of 59,637 women in the Nurses' Health Study who reported total duration of antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, 60 +, or during the past 4 years. We used Cox Proportional Hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between categories of antibiotic use and risk of <e5>@DDF$ PD.@/DDF$</e5>  One hundred and eighty cases of <e6>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e6> were confirmed during the follow-up. Self-reported antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, and 60 +, as assessed in 2004, was not significantly associated with <e7>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e7> risk in our cohort. The hazard ratio comparing participants who used antibiotics for 2 or more months vs. 1-14 days at age 20-39 was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.78), at age 40-59 was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.33), and at age 60 +was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.47). Antibiotic use during the past four years, as assessed in 2008, was also not associated with future risk of <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8> (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.10). In this cohort study, we did not observe a significant association between antibiotic use and incidence <e9>@DDF$ PD.@/DDF$</e9>  A major limitation of our study is assessment of exposure, which required many participants to recall their antibiotic use decades in the past. Thus, although the results of this study do not support an effect of antibiotic use on <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10> risk, larger investigations relying on records of antibiotic prescriptions would provide more definitive evidence.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Microbiota-mediated effects of <e1>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e1> medications on <e2>@DDF$ Parkinsonian @/DDF$</e2> non-motor symptoms in male transgenic mice. <e3>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e3> (<e4>@DDF$ PD)@/DDF$</e4>  is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, <e5>@DDF$ depression,@/DDF$</e5>  and <e6>@DDF$ anxiety.@/DDF$</e6>  Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of <e7>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e7> and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the <e8>@anatomical location$ ileum.@/anatomical location$</e8>  Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of <e9>@DDF$ constipation,@/DDF$</e9>  possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of <e10>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e10> (<e11>@DDF$ PD)@/DDF$</e11>  are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa). PD has also been associated with altered <e12>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e12> microbiota composition. However, the effects of these <e13>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e13> medications on <e14>@DDF$ PD-@/DDF$</e14> related non-motor symptoms and the <e15>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e15> microbiota have not been well characterized. This study uses a transgenic mouse model of <e16>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e16> to help resolve medication-induced microbiota alterations from those that are potentially disease relevant within a <e17>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e17> context, and explores how long-term treatment may interact with the <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> microbiota to impact non-motor symptoms.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

New perspectives on cytoskeletal dysregulation and mitochondrial mislocalization in <e1>@DDF$ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.@/DDF$</e1>  <e2>@DDF$ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ ALS)@/DDF$</e3>  is a <e4>@DDF$ progressive neurodegenerative disease @/DDF$</e4> characterized by selective, early degeneration of motor neurons in the <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> and <e6>@anatomical location$ spinal cord.@/anatomical location$</e6>  Motor neurons have long axonal projections, which rely on the integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton and mitochondria to regulate energy requirements for maintaining axonal stability, anterograde and retrograde transport, and signaling between neurons. The formation of protein aggregates which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunction both have devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological features across several <e7>@DDF$ neurodegenerative conditions,@/DDF$</e7>  including <e8>@DDF$ ALS,@/DDF$</e8>  <e9>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease,@/DDF$</e9>  <e10>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease,@/DDF$</e10>  <e11>@DDF$ Huntington's disease @/DDF$</e11> and <e12>@DDF$ Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.@/DDF$</e12>  Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cytoskeletal integrity and mitochondrial function are intricately linked. Therefore, dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and mitochondrial homeostasis and localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration. Here we review and discuss known contributors, including variants in genetic loci and aberrant protein activities, which modify cytoskeletal integrity, axonal transport and mitochondrial localization in ALS and have overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we explore some emerging pathways that may contribute to this disruption in ALS.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Role of the <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbiome in Autism Spectrum Disorders. <e2>@DDF$ Autism spectrum disorder @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ ASD)@/DDF$</e3>  is a severe <e4>@DDF$ neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorder @/DDF$</e4> with elusive etiology and obscure pathophysiology. Cognitive inabilities, impaired communication, repetitive behavior pattern, and restricted social interaction and communication lead to a debilitating situation in <e5>@DDF$ autism.@/DDF$</e5>  The pattern of co-occurrence of medical comorbidities is most intriguing in <e6>@DDF$ autism,@/DDF$</e6>  compared to any other neurodevelopmental disorders. They have an elevated comorbidity burden among which most frequently are seizures, <e7>@DDF$ psychiatric illness,@/DDF$</e7>  and <e8>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e8> disorders. The <e9>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e9> microbiota is believed to play a pivotal role in human health and disease through involvement in physiological homoeostasis, immunological development, <e10>@chemical$ glutathione @/chemical$</e10> metabolism, <e11>@chemical$ amino acid @/chemical$</e11> metabolism, etc., which in a reasonable way explain the role of <e12>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e12> axis in <e13>@DDF$ autism.@/DDF$</e13>  Branded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with <e14>@DDF$ psychiatric impairment @/DDF$</e14> and often misclassified as a <e15>@DDF$ mental disorder,@/DDF$</e15>  many experts in the field think that a therapeutic solution to <e16>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e16> is unlikely to emerge. As the pathophysiology is still elusive, taking into account of the various symptoms that are concurrent in <e17>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e17> is important. <e18>@anatomical location$ Gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e18> problems that are seen associated with most of the <e19>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e19> cases suggest that it is not just a <e20>@DDF$ psychiatric disorder @/DDF$</e20> as many claim but have a physiological base, and alleviating the <e21>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e21> problems could help alleviating the symptoms by bringing out the much needed overall improvement in the affected victims. A <e22>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e22> disorder akin to <e23>@DDF$ Crohn's disease @/DDF$</e23> is, sometimes, reported in autistic children, an extremely painful gastrointestinal disease which is named as autistic enterocolitis. This disturbed situation hypothesized to be initiated by dysbiosis or microbial imbalance could in turn perturb the coordination of microbiota-gut-brain axis which is important in human mental health as goes the popular dictum: "fix your gut, fix your brain."

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Gut microbiota composition in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a pilot study. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is considered a systemic inflammatory disease and is characterized by intermittent hypoxia that can damage the integrity of intestinal barrier and alter gut microbiota composition in adults and animal models. To date there is only one study on snoring children and microbiota but no studies are present on paediatric OSAS related dysbiosis. To evaluate gut microbiota composition in OSAS children in respect to healthy subjects and investigate the role of sleep parameters in changing gut microbiome. Sixteen children divided in OSAS and healthy groups. Stool samples were coll<e5>@anatomical location$ ecte@/anatomical location$</e5> d from both the two groups to assess gut microbiota composition u<e6>@anatomical location$ sing 16S rRNA @/anatomical location$</e6> sequencing and a nocturnal pulsossimetry and polys<e7>@anatomical location$ omno@/anatomical location$</e7> graphy were performed in OSAS children. OSAS children showed a decreased microbial diversity in respect to healthy subjects in terms of number of observed species and Chao1 index (p = 0,01). Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was directly correlated to Sleep Clinical Record (p = 0,03). The abundance of several <e1>@DDF$ inflammation-@/DDF$</e1> related strains (Proteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Klebsiella) were found significantly modified in relation to sleep parameters. Bacteria implied in the gut barrier integrity (Desulfovibrionaceae, Bacteroides fragilis and <e8>@anatomical location$ Faecalibacte@/anatomical location$</e8> rium prausnitzii) were found significantly different in the two study groups and correlated with sleep parameters. <e2>@DDF$ OSAS @/DDF$</e2> children showed a lower microbiota diversity in respect to heathy subjects and an increase of <e3>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e3> and gut barrier disruptors-<e9>@anatomical location$ related stra@/anatomical location$</e9> ins probably induced by intermittent hypoxia. Further studies should be conducted to understand the role of gut microbiota in <e4>@<e10>@anatomical location$ DDF$@/anatomical location$</e10>  OSAS @/DDF$</e4> physiopathology and comorbidities in children.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Effects of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> Subsp. <i>lactis</i> (BPL1) Supplementation in Children and Adolescents with <e1>@DDF$ Prader-Willi Syndrome:@/DDF$</e1>  A Randomized Crossover Trial. <e2>@DDF$ Prader-Willi syndrome @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ PWS)@/DDF$</e3>  is a rare <e4>@DDF$ genetic disorder @/DDF$</e4> characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including <e5>@DDF$ obesity,@/DDF$</e5>  <e6>@DDF$ hyperphagia,@/DDF$</e6>  and behavioral problems. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strain BPL1 has been shown to improve central adiposity in <e7>@anatomical location$ adults @/anatomical location$</e7> with <e8>@DDF$ simple obesity.@/DDF$</e8>  To evaluate BPL1's effects in children with <e9>@DDF$ PWS,@/DDF$</e9>  we performed a randomized crossover trial among 39 patients (mean age 10.4 years). Participants were randomized to placebo-<e10>@chemical$ BPL1 @/chemical$</e10> (<i>n</i> = 19) or <e11>@chemical$ BPL1-@/chemical$</e11> placebo (<i>n</i> = 20) sequences and underwent a 12-week period with placebo/<e12>@chemical$ BPL1 @/chemical$</e12> treatments, a 12-week washout period, and a 12-week period with the crossover treatment. Thirty-five subjects completed the study. The main outcome was changes in adiposity, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included lipid and glucose metabolism, <e13>@DDF$ hyperphagia,@/DDF$</e13>  and mental health symptoms. Generalized linear modeling was applied to assess differences between treatments. While BPL1 did not modify total fat mass compared to placebo, BPL1 decreased <e14>@anatomical location$ abdominal @/anatomical location$</e14> adiposity in a subgroup of patients older than 4.5 years (<i>n</i> = 28). BPL1 improved fasting <e15>@gene$ insulin @/gene$</e15> concentration and <e16>@gene$ insulin @/gene$</e16> sensitivity. Furthermore, we observed modest improvements in some mental health symptoms. A follow-up trial with a longer treatment period is warranted to determine whether BPL1 supplementation can provide a long-term therapeutic approach for children with <e17>@DDF$ PWS @/DDF$</e17> (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03548480).

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Understanding the potential causes of <e1>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e1> dysfunctions in <e2>@DDF$ multiple system atrophy.@/DDF$</e2>  Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, <e3>@DDF$ progressive neurodegenerative disorder @/DDF$</e3> characterised by autonomic, pyramidal, parkinsonian and/or cerebellar dysfunction. Autonomic symptoms of MSA include deficits associated with the <e4>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e4> (<e5>@anatomical location$ GI)@/anatomical location$</e5>  <e6>@anatomical location$ system,@/anatomical location$</e6>  such as difficulty swallowing, <e7>@anatomical location$ abdominal @/anatomical location$</e7> pain and bloating, nausea, delayed <e8>@anatomical location$ gastric @/anatomical location$</e8> emptying, and constipation. To date, studies assessing <e9>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e9> <e10>@DDF$ dysfunctions @/DDF$</e10> in <e11>@DDF$ MSA @/DDF$</e11> have primarily focused on alterations of the <e12>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e12> microbiome, however growing evidence indicates other structural components of the <e13>@anatomical location$ GI tract,@/anatomical location$</e13>  such as the <e14>@anatomical location$ enteric nervous system,@/anatomical location$</e14>  the <e15>@anatomical location$ intestinal barrier,@/anatomical location$</e15>  <e16>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e16> hormones, and the <e17>@anatomical location$ GI-@/anatomical location$</e17> driven immune response may contribute to <e18>@DDF$ MSA-@/DDF$</e18> related <e19>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e19> symptoms. Here, we provide an in-depth exploration of the physiological, structural, and immunological changes theorised to underpin <e20>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e20> dysfunction in <e21>@DDF$ MSA @/DDF$</e21> patients and highlight areas for future research in order to identify more suitable pharmaceutical treatments for <e22>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e22> symptoms in patients with <e23>@DDF$ MSA.@/DDF$</e23>

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Its main pathological feature is the degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons related to the misfolding and aggregation of <e5>@gene$ α-synuclein.@/gene$</e5>  The pathogenesis of <e6>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e6> has not yet been fully elucidated, and its occurrence and development process are closely related to the microbiota-<e7>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e7> axis. Dysregulation of <e8>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e8> microbiota may promote the damage of the <e9>@anatomical location$ intestinal epithelial barrier,@/anatomical location$</e9>  <e10>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e10> inflammation, and the upward diffusion of phosphorylated <e11>@gene$ α-synuclein @/gene$</e11> from the <e12>@anatomical location$ enteric nervous system @/anatomical location$</e12> (<e13>@anatomical location$ ENS)@/anatomical location$</e13>  to the <e14>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e14> in susceptible individuals and further lead to <e15>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e15> dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of the <e16>@anatomical location$ central nervous system @/anatomical location$</e16> (<e17>@anatomical location$ CNS)@/anatomical location$</e17>  through the disordered microbiota-<e18>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e18> axis. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on the role of the microbiota-<e19>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e19> axis in the pathogenesis of <e20>@DDF$ PD,@/DDF$</e20>  especially the mechanism of <e21>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e21> microbiome dysregulation, <e22>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e22> inflammation, and <e23>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e23> dysfunction in <e24>@DDF$ PD.@/DDF$</e24>  Maintaining or restoring homeostasis in the gut microenvironment by targeting the gut microbiome may provide future direction for the development of new biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and therapeutic strategies to slow disease progression.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Altered <e1>@anatomical location$ Gut @/anatomical location$</e1> Microbiome and Intestinal Pathology in <e2>@DDF$ Parkinson's Disease.@/DDF$</e2>  <e3>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e3> (<e4>@DDF$ PD)@/DDF$</e4>  is a common <e5>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorder @/DDF$</e5> arising from an interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. Studies have suggested that the pathological hallmarks of intraneuronal <e6>@gene$ α-synuclein @/gene$</e6> aggregations may start from the olfactory bulb and the <e7>@anatomical location$ enteric nervous system @/anatomical location$</e7> of the gut and later propagate to the <e8>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e8> via the olfactory tract and the <e9>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve.@/anatomical location$</e9>  This hypothesis correlates well with clinical symptoms, such as constipation, that may develop up to 20 years before the onset of PD motor symptoms. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to vigorous research into the <e10>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e10> pathology and <e11>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e11> microbiota changes in patients with PD. In this review, we provide current clinical and pathological evidence of <e12>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e12> involvement in PD by summarizing the changes in <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> microbiota composition and <e14>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e14> inflammation associated with its pathogenesis.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Altered Fecal Microbiota Composition in Older Adults With <e1>@DDF$ Frailty.@/DDF$</e1>  Frailty is a common <e2>@DDF$ geriatric syndrome @/DDF$</e2> that is diagnosed and staged based mainly on symptoms. We aimed to evaluate <e3>@DDF$ frailty-@/DDF$</e3> related alterations of the intestinal permeability and profile fecal microbiota of healthy and frail older adults to identify microbial biomarkers of this syndrome. We collected serum and fecal samples from 94 community-dwelling older adults, along with anthropometric, medical, mental health, and lifestyle data. Serum inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and HGMB1 and the intestinal permeability biomarker zonulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was performed to determine the fecal composition of fecal microbiota. We analyzed the diversity and composition differences of the gut microbiota in the two groups and assessed the relationship between the changes in microbiota structure and clinical biomarkers. Older adults with <e4>@DDF$ frailty @/DDF$</e4> showed higher concentrations of IL-6, HGMB1, and zonulin. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index and evenness indices or species richness of fecal microbiota between the two groups, we found significant microbiota structure differences. Compared with the control group, fecal samples from the frail group had higher levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, an<e6>@bacteria$ d <i>Klebsiella<@/bacteria$</e6> /i> and lower levels of the commensal genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, and <i>Blautia.</i> Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the intergenus interactions were more common in healthy controls than older adults with frailty. <i>Escherichia<e7>@DDF$ </i>/<i>@/DDF$</e7> Shigella</i>, <i>Pyramidobacter</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were positively correlated with IL-6, while <i>Faecalib<e8>@gene$ acter@/gene$</e8> ium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> were negatively correlated with IL-6. <i>Alistipes</i> <e9>@gene$ were @/gene$</e9> found to be positively correlated with HGMB1. <i>Akkermansia</<e10>@gene$ i> and@/gene$</e10>  <i>Alistipes</i> were linked to the increased serum level of inflamma<e11>@anatomical location$ tory f@/anatomical location$</e11> actors and intestinal permeability<e12>@anatomical location$ .

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal

The Role of Physical Exercise and Omega-3 Fatty Acids in <e1>@DDF$ Depressive Illness @/DDF$</e1> in the Elderly. In adulthood, depression is the most common type of mental illness and will be the second leading cause of disease by 2020. <e2>@DDF$ Major depression @/DDF$</e2> dramatically affects the function of the central nervous system and degrades the quality of life, especially in old age. Several mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of <e3>@DDF$ depressive illness,@/DDF$</e3>  since it has a multifactorial etiology. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that <e4>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e4> is mainly associated with imbalances in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, brain volume changes, neurogenesis dysfunction, and dysregulation <e10>@anatomical location$ of inflammatory pathways. Also the g@/anatomical location$</e10> ut microbiota<e11>@anatomical location$  may i@/anatomical location$</e11> nfluence mental health outcomes. Although <e5>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e5> is not a consequenc<e12>@anatomical location$ e of@/anatomical location$</e12>  normal aging, depressive disorders are common in later life, even if often undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed in old age. When untreated, <e6>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e6> reduces life expectancy, worsens medical illnesses, enhances health care costs and is the primary cause of suicide among older people. To date, the underpinnings of depression in the elderly are still to be understood, and the pharmacological treatment is the most commonly used therapy. Since a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits have recently emerged as crucial contributors to the genesis and course of <e7>@DDF$ depression,@/DDF$</e7>  in the present review, we have focused on the effects of physical activity and omega-3 fatty acids on <e8>@DDF$ depressive illness @/DDF$</e8> in the elderly. A growing literature indicates that both exercise and dietary interventions can promote mental health throughout one's lifespan. There thus emerges the awareness that an active lifestyle and a balanced diet may constitute valid low-cost prevention strategies to counteract <e9>@DDF$ depressive illness @/DDF$</e9> in the elderly.

Parkinson's Disease: A Multisystem Disorder. The way <e1>@DDF$ sporadic Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e1> (PD) is perceived has undergone drastic changes in recent decades. For a long time, PD was considered a brain disease characterized by motor disturbances; however, the identification of several risk factors and the hypothesis that PD has a <e2>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal @/anatomical location$</e2> onset have shed additional light. Today, after recognition of prodromal non-motor symptoms and the pathological processes driving their evolution, there is a greater understanding of the involvement of other <e3>@anatomical location$ organ systems.@/anatomical location$</e3>  For this reason, PD is increasingly seen as a multiorgan and multisystemic pathology that arises from the interaction of susceptible genetic factors with a challenging environment during aging-related decline.

Selective ablation of <e16>@gene$ Drd2,@/gene$</e16>  but not <e17>@gene$ Drd4,@/gene$</e17>  in the <e18>@anatomical location$ intestinal epithelium,@/anatomical location$</e18>  caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <e19>@anatomical location$ substantia nigra @/anatomical location$</e19> following <e20>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e20> challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of <e21>@chemical$ succinate-@/chemical$</e21> producing Alleoprevotella in the <e22>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e22> microbiota. Administration of <e23>@chemical$ succinate @/chemical$</e23> markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in <e24>@chemical$ MPTP-@/chemical$</e24> treated mice by elevating the <e25>@anatomical location$ mitochondrial membrane @/anatomical location$</e25> potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

The Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Protocol for a Phase 1, Open-Label Study. The bidirectional signaling between the <e1>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e1> microbiota and the <e2>@anatomical location$ brain,@/anatomical location$</e2>  known as the <e3>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e3> axis, is being heavily explored in current neuropsychiatric research. Analyses of the human <e4>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e4> microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> function, and potentially mood and <e6>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e6> symptoms, through <e7>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e7> axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that <e8>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e8> microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of <e9>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e10> by recolonizing the <e11>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal (GI) tract @/anatomical location$</e11> with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to <e12>@biomedical technique$ FMT,@/biomedical technique$</e12>  which comprises 40 different strains of <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> bacteria from a healthy donor. The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and <e14>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e14> before, during, and after administration of <e15>@chemical$ MET-2.@/chemical$</e15>  The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy <e16>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e16> bacteria, the safety and tolerability of <e17>@chemical$ MET-2,@/chemical$</e17>  and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of <e18>@DDF$ depression/anxiety @/DDF$</e18> and the response to treatment. Adults experiencing <e19>@DDF$ depressive @/DDF$</e19> or <e20>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e20> will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, <e21>@DDF$ anxiety,@/DDF$</e21>  and <e22>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e22> symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from <e23>@anatomical location$ blood @/anatomical location$</e23> and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety. Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed. This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability. DERR1-10.2196/17223.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",

Gut Microbiota in Bipolar Depression and Its Relationship to Brain Function: An Advanced Exploration. The mechanism of <e1>@DDF$ bipolar disorder @/DDF$</e1> is unclear. Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in mental disorders. This study aimed to find out changes in the gut microbiota in <e2>@DDF$ bipolar depression @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ BD)@/DDF$</e3>  subjects following treatment with <e4>@drug$ quetiapine @/drug$</e4> and evaluate their correlations with the <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> and <e6>@anatomical location$ immune @/anatomical location$</e6> function. Totally 36 subjects with <e7>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e7> and 27 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The severity of <e8>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e8> was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg <e9>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e9> rating scale (MADRS). At baseline, <e10>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e10> samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). T lymphocyte subsets were measured to examine <e11>@anatomical location$ immune @/anatomical location$</e11> function. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess <e12>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e12> function. All <e13>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e13> subjects received <e14>@drug$ quetiapine @/drug$</e14> treatment (300 mg/d) for four weeks, following which the <e15>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e15> microbiota and <e16>@anatomical location$ immune @/anatomical location$</e16> profiles were reexamined. Here, we first put forward the new concept of <e17>@anatomical location$ brain-gut @/anatomical location$</e17> coefficient of balance (B-G<sub>CB</sub>), which referred to the ratio of [oxygenated hemoglobin]/(<i>Bifidobacteria</i> to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> ratio), to analyze the linkage between the <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> microbiota and <e19>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e19> function. At baseline, the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion was positively correlated with log<sub>10</sub> Enterobacter spp count, whereas the correlativity between the other bacteria and <e20>@anatomical location$ immune @/anatomical location$</e20> profiles were negative. Log<sub>10</sub> B-G<sub><e21>@statistical technique$ CB<@/statistical technique$</e21> /sub> was positively correlated with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

LAT treatment reestablished the bacterial abundance and diversity and increased the production of butyric acid in the gut that was inhibited by CSDS. The levels of butyric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and positively correlated with those of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes across all treatment groups. The current data suggest that, similar to fluoxetine, LAT show antidepressant-like effects in mice exposed to CSDS through the modulation of the gut-brain axis.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal
2. Bacteria -> part of -> Microbiome
3. Chemical -> located in -> [Anatomical Loc., Human, Animal]

21. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> change abundance -> [Bacteria, Microbiome]
22. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> interact -> Chemical
23. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> affect -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
24. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> is a -> Disease, Disorder, or Finding
25. Disease, Disorder, or Finding -> target -> [Human, Animal]

The Influence of Topinambur and Inulin Preventive Supplementation on Microbiota, Anxious Behavior, Cognitive Functions and Neurogenesis in Mice Exposed to the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress. Daily living and functioning under stress can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Over the past decades, a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between the <e1>@anatomical location$ central nervous system @/anatomical location$</e1> (<e2>@anatomical location$ CNS)@/anatomical location$</e2> , <e3>@anatomical location$ intestinal @/anatomical location$</e3> flora and bidirectional communication along the <e4>@anatomical location$ gut brain axis @/anatomical location$</e4> (<e5>@anatomical location$ GBA)@/anatomical location$</e5>  in the maintaining of homeostasis. One of the most important factors regulating GBA functioning in exposure to stress may be a proper diet enriched in the supplementation with pre-, pro-and synbiotics. In the present study, we examined whether a 10-week <e6>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e6> preventive supplementation with natural prebiotics: topinambur powder (TPB) and chicory root inulin (INU) influenced an <e7>@DDF$ anxiety,@/DDF$</e7>  <e8>@DDF$ depressive behavior @/DDF$</e8> and cognition in mice exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Additionally, a <e9>@chemical$ fluoxetine @/chemical$</e9> (<e10>@chemical$ FLU)@/chemical$</e10>  has been used as a reference antidepressive drug. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of <e11>@chemical$ TPB,@/chemical$</e11>  <e12>@chemical$ INU @/chemical$</e12> and <e13>@chemical$ FLU @/chemical$</e13> administration on neurogenesis in mice exposed to CUMS and finally analyzed <e14>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e14> microbiota for possible changes after <e15>@chemical$ TPB @/chemical$</e15> and <e16>@chemical$ INU @/chemical$</e16> supplementation in <e17>@DDF$ CUMS @/DDF$</e17> induced mice. Results obtained from the behavioral studies (elevated plaze maze, forced swim and Morris water maze test) indicated, that 10 week supplementation with <e18>@chemical$ TPB @/chemical$</e18> (250 mg/kg) and <e19>@chemical$ INU @/chemical$</e19> (66 mg/kg), similarly to <e20>@chemical$ FLU @/chemical$</e20> (12 mg/kg), significantly mitigated an anxiety and stress as well as protected learning and memory functions in the CUMS induced mice compared to the control stressed group. Additionally, TPB and INU CUMS mice showed significantly higher level of neurogenesis in comparison to control CUMS group. Interestingly, results obtained from the fecal microbiota analysis showed a beneficial effect of TPB and INU supplementation against CUMS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that a long-term, preventive supplementation with TPB or INU alleviates the negative effects such as anxiety, cognitive disorders or dysbiosis in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",

            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON
10. Start response with {

Defined relations (subject -> predicate -> object):
1. Bacteria -> located in -> Animal
2. Bacteria -> part of -> Microbiome
3. Chemical -> located in -> [Anatomical Loc., Human, Animal]
4. Chemical -> interact -> Chemical

Text to analyze:
Systematic review of evidence to support the theory of psychobiotics. The theory that supplemented probiotic bacteria could affect psychological outcomes has recently been outlined in narrative reviews; to date, however, this area of research has not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this review was to compare the effects of probiotics with those of placebo on psychological outcomes and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. The <e2>@DDF$ Cochrane Central Regis@/DDF$</e2> ter of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched electronically for studies published up to July 17, 2014. Reference lists of relevant articles were searched manually. Only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled <e1>@human$ human @/human$</e1> trials that used a standardized, validated scale to assess the effects of probiotic interventions compared with placebo on psychological outcomes or symptoms of psychiatric disorders were included. Two researchers independently assessed trials and evaluated them for methodological quality. Data were extracted from the included studies using a data extraction form. Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Overall, there is very limited evidence for the efficacy of probiotic interventions in psychological outcomes. The evidence base is incomplete and lacks applicability. More trials are necessary before any inferences can be made about the efficacy of probiotics in mental health applications.

<s><s>[INST] You are an information extraction assistant working on biomedical abstracts tagged with structured entity information. Your goal is to extract relation triples about the gut microbiota and its connections to Parkinson’s disease and mental health.
Use the provided constituency trees for each sentence and the tagged text to extract relationship between them.

Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs
- Inner tags: @entityType$ ... @/entityType$ for entity type

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:
{
    "ternary_tag_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Task B - Mention-Based Relations. Identify the actual entities involved in a relation and predict the type of relation:
{
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
        {
            "subject_text_span": "intestinal microbiome",
            "subject_outter_label": "<e1>",
            "subject_label": "microbiome",
            "predicate": "located in",
            "object_text_span": "patients",
            "object_outter_label": "<e4>",
            "object_label": "human"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations
5. Preserve EXACT entity mention text from tags
6. NO explanations/thoughts/caveats
7. Output MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY
8. NO markdown code blocks
9. NO text before/after JSON

The endotoxin hypothesis of <e1>@DDF$ neurodegeneration.@/DDF$</e1>  The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration is the hypothesis that endotoxin causes or contributes to <e2>@DDF$ neurodegeneration.@/DDF$</e2>  Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting much of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, present at high concentrations in gut, gums and skin and in other tissue during <e3>@DDF$ bacterial infection.@/DDF$</e3>  <e4>@anatomical location$ Blood plasma @/anatomical location$</e4> levels of endotoxin are normally low, but are elevated during <e5>@DDF$ infections,@/DDF$</e5>  <e6>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e6> inflammation, <e7>@anatomical location$ gum @/anatomical location$</e7> disease and <e8>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disease.@/DDF$</e8>  Adding endotoxin at such levels to <e9>@anatomical location$ blood @/anatomical location$</e9> of healthy <e10>@human$ humans @/human$</e10> induces systemic inflammation and <e11>@anatomical location$ brain microglial @/anatomical location$</e11> activation. Adding high levels of endotoxin to the <e12>@anatomical location$ blood @/anatomical location$</e12> or body of rodents induces microglial activation, priming and/or tolerance, memory deficits and loss of <e13>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e13> synapses and neurons. Endotoxin promotes <e14>@gene$ amyloid β @/gene$</e14> and <e15>@gene$ tau @/gene$</e15> aggregation and neuropathology, suggesting the possibility that endotoxin synergises with different aggregable proteins to give different <e16>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases.@/DDF$</e16>  <e17>@anatomical location$ Blood @/anatomical location$</e17> and <e18>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e18> endotoxin levels are elevated in <e19>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease,@/DDF$</e19>  which is accelerated by <e20>@DDF$ systemic infections,@/DDF$</e20>  including <e21>@anatomical location$ gum @/anatomical location$</e21> disease. Endotoxin binds directly to <e22>@gene$ APOE,@/gene$</e22>  and the APOE4 variant both sensitises to endotoxin and predisposes to <e23>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease.@/DDF$</e23>  <e24>@anatomical location$ Intestinal @/anatomical location$</e24> permeability increases early in <e25>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease,@/DDF$</e25>  and injection of endotoxin into mice induces α-synuclein production and aggregation, as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The gut microbiome changes in Parkinson's disease, and changing the endotoxin-producing bacterial species can affect the disease in patients and mouse models. Blood endotoxin is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and endotoxin promotes TDP-43 aggregation and neuropathology. Peripheral diseases that elevate blood endotoxin, such as sepsis, AIDS and liver failure, also result in neurodegeneration. Endotoxin directly and indirectly activates microglia that damage neurons via nitric oxide, oxidants and cytokines, and by phagocytosis of synapses and neurons. The endotoxin hypothesis is unproven, but if correct, then neurodegeneration may be reduced by decreasing endotoxin levels or endotoxin-induced neuroinflammation.
