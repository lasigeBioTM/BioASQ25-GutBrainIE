The role of bacteria in <e4>@DDF$ CNS autoimmunity @/DDF$</e4> has also been highlighted by changes in the diversity of <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e5> in <e6>@human$ patients @/human$</e6> with <e7>@DDF$ neurological diseases @/DDF$</e7> such as <e8>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e8>, <e9>@DDF$ Alzheimer disease @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e10>, emphasizing the role of the gut-brain axis. We discuss the hypothesis of a <e11>@microbiome$ brain microbiota @/microbiome$</e11>, the <e12>@microbiome$ BrainBiota @/microbiome$</e12>: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the <e13>@anatomical location$ human brain @/anatomical location$</e13> is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of <e14>@chemical$ bacterial proteins @/chemical$</e14>, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of brain development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e15>. We further suggest that changes of the <e16>@microbiome$ BrainBiota @/microbiome$</e16> during <e17>@DDF$ brain diseases @/DDF$</e17> may be the consequence or cause of the <e18>@DDF$ chronic inflammation @/DDF$</e18> similarly to the <e19>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e19>."

In the present study, IgA-Biome analyses identified a unique proinflammatory microbial signature in the IgA+ fraction of those with <e20>@DDF$ AR @/DDF$</e20> that would have otherwise been undetected using conventional <e21>@biomedical technique$ microbiome analysis approaches @/biomedical technique$</e21>."

The current study aimed to explore the association between <e9>@microbiome$ oral and gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9> in <e10>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e10> to clarify whether <e11>@microbiome$ oral microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> could ectopically colonize into the <e12>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e12>. 16S rRNA sequence libraries were used to compare oral and gut microbial profiles in <e13>@human$ persons @/human$</e13> with <e14>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e15> (<e16>@human$ HC @/human$</e16>). Source Tracker and NetShift were used to identify bacteria responsible for ectopic colonization and indicate the driver function of <e17>@bacteria$ ectopic colonization bacteria @/bacteria$</e17>. The \u03b1-diversity of <e18>@microbiome$ oral microbiota @/microbiome$</e18> and <e19>@microbiome$ intestinal microbiota @/microbiome$</e19> was significantly decreased in <e20>@human$ persons @/human$</e20> with <e21>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e21> (all <i>p</i> <\u20090.05). <e22>@statistical technique$ Principal coordinate analysis @/statistical technique$</e22> indicated greater similarity between <e23>@microbiome$ oral and gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23> in <e24>@human$ persons @/human$</e24> with <e25>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e25> than that in <e26>@human$ HC @/human$</e26>, and oral-gut overlaps in microbiota were found for 9 genera in <e27>@human$ persons @/human$</e27> with <e28>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e28> relative to only 3 genera in <e29>@human$ HC @/human$</e29>. The contribution ratio of <e30>@microbiome$ oral microbiota @/microbiome$</e30> to intestinal microbiota composition in <e31>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e31> is 5.26% based on Source Tracker\uff0cand the <e32>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e32> with ectopic colonization showed the daily maximum standard drinks, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin content, and PACS scores decreasing (all <i>p</i> <\u20090.05). Results highlight the connection between <e33>@microbiome$ oral-gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e33> in <e34>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e34> and suggest novel potential mechanistic possibilities."

A vast number of signals generated in the <e18>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e18> (<e19>@anatomical location$ GIT @/anatomical location$</e19>) reach the <e20>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e20> via afferent fibers of the <e21>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e21> (<e22>@anatomical location$ VN @/anatomical location$</e22>). Signals from the CNS are returned to entero-epithelial cells (EES) via efferent VN fibers and communicate with 100 to 500 million <e23>@chemical$ neurons @/chemical$</e23> in the submucosa and myenteric plexus of the gut wall, which is referred to as the enteric nervous system (ENS). Intercommunications between the <e24>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e24> and CNS regulate mood, cognitive behavior, and <e25>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e25> such as <e26>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e26>, <e27>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e27>, and <e28>@DDF$ schizophrenia @/DDF$</e28>. The modulation, development, and renewal of nerves in the ENS and changes in the <e29>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e29> alter the synthesis and degradation of neurotransmitters, ultimately influencing our mental health. The more we decipher the <e30>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e30> and understand its effect on neurotransmission, the closer we may get to developing novel therapeutic and psychobiotic compounds to improve cognitive functions and prevent <e31>@DDF$ mental disorders @/DDF$</e31>. In this review, the intricate control of entero-endocrine signaling and immune responses that keep the <e32>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e32> in a balanced state, and the influence that <e33>@bacteria$ changing gut bacteria @/bacteria$</e33> have on <e34>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e34>, are discussed."

In the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm, ~60-70% <e4>@animal$ rats @/animal$</e4> are susceptible to LH in the face of inescapable electric stress. The role of <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e5> in susceptibility in the LH paradigm is unknown. In this study, <e6>@animal$ male rats @/animal$</e6> were exposed to inescapable electric stress under the LH paradigm. The compositions of <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> and <e8>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e8> were assessed in fecal samples from <e9>@animal$ control rats @/animal$</e9>, <e10>@animal$ non-LH (resilient) rats @/animal$</e10>, and <e11>@animal$ LH (susceptible) rats @/animal$</e11>. Members of the order <e12>@bacteria$ Lactobacillales @/bacteria$</e12> were present at significantly higher levels in the <e13>@animal$ susceptible rats @/animal$</e13> than in <e14>@animal$ control and resilient rats @/animal$</e14>. At the family level, the number of <e15>@bacteria$ Lactobacillaceae @/bacteria$</e15> in the <e16>@animal$ susceptible rats @/animal$</e16> was significantly higher than in <e17>@animal$ control and resilient rats @/animal$</e17>. At the genus level, the numbers of <e18>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e18>, <e19>@bacteria$ Clostridium cluster III @/bacteria$</e19>, and <e20>@bacteria$ Anaerofustis @/bacteria$</e20> in <e21>@animal$ susceptible rats @/animal$</e21> were significantly higher than in <e22>@animal$ control and resilient rats @/animal$</e22>. Levels of <e23>@chemical$ acetic acid @/chemical$</e23> and <e24>@chemical$ propionic acid @/chemical$</e24> in the feces of <e25>@animal$ susceptible rats @/animal$</e25> were lower than in those of <e26>@animal$ control and resilient rats @/animal$</e26>; however, the levels of <e27>@chemical$ lactic acid @/chemical$</e27> in the <e28>@animal$ susceptible rats @/animal$</e28> were higher than those of <e29>@animal$ control and resilient rats @/animal$</e29>. There was a positive correlation between <e30>@chemical$ lactic acid @/chemical$</e30> and Lactobacillus levels among these three groups. These findings suggest that abnormal composition of the <e31>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e31>, including organisms such as <e32>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e32>, contributes to susceptibility versus resilience to LH in <e33>@animal$ rats @/animal$</e33> subjected to inescapable electric foot shock. Therefore, it appears likely that brain-gut axis plays a role in stress susceptibility in the LH paradigm."

The functional outputs of the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4>, such as <e5>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e5>, are considered particularly important in this regard. Significant associations exist between alterations in the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa and <e6>@DDF$ mental health disorders @/DDF$</e6>. <e7>@dietary supplement$ Dietary fiber @/dietary supplement$</e7> has the potential to alter gut microbiota composition and function, modifying bacterial enzymatic function and the production of metabolites. As many taxa of microorganisms have enzymes capable of producing or degrading <e8>@chemical$ neurochemicals @/chemical$</e8> i.e. neuroactive gut brain modules, new predictive tools can be applied to existing datasets such as those harvested from dietary fiber interventions.

We aim to also extract from the selected studies publicly available microbial genomic sequence datasets for reanalysis with a consistent bioinformatics pipeline, with the ultimate intention of identifying altered gut brain modules following <e11>@dietary supplement$ dietary fiber @/dietary supplement$</e11> interventions. Interventional trials and randomized controlled studies that are originally published, including cross-over and non-crossover design and involving <e12>@human$ healthy adult humans @/human$</e12> will be included. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, two electronic databases, will be completed. Various types of <e13>@dietary supplement$ dietary fiber @/dietary supplement$</e13> have an impact on the <e14>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> composition, with some promoting the growth of particular taxa while others are reduced in relative abundance. Our search focuses on the impact of this food component on the microbiota of <e15>@human$ healthy individuals @/human$</e15>. Compositional gut microbial changes have been reported and our review will compile and update these observations after reanalysis of their datasets with a consistent bioinformatic pipeline. From this it may be possible to predict more detailed functional consequences in terms of neuroactive gut brain modules, of the compositional alterations in gut microbial taxa."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e5>@chemical$ Flavonoids @/chemical$</e5> are a biodiverse family of dietary compounds that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial cell protective profiles. They have received considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents in biomedicine and have been widely used in traditional complimentary medicine for generations. Such complimentary medical herbal formulations are extremely complex mixtures of many <e6>@chemical$ pharmacologically active compounds @/chemical$</e6> that provide a therapeutic outcome through a network pharmacological effects of considerable complexity. Methods are emerging to determine the active components used in complimentary medicine and their therapeutic targets and to decipher the complexities of how network pharmacology provides such therapeutic effects. The <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e7> has important roles to play in the generation of <e8>@chemical$ bioactive flavonoid metabolites @/chemical$</e8> retaining or exceeding the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the <e9>@chemical$ intact flavonoid @/chemical$</e9> and, in some cases, new antitumor and antineurodegenerative bioactivities. Certain <e10>@food$ food items @/food$</e10> have been identified with high prebiotic profiles suggesting that <e11>@dietary supplement$ neutraceutical supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e11> may be beneficially employed to preserve a healthy population of <e12>@bacteria$ bacterial symbiont species @/bacteria$</e12> and minimize the establishment of <e13>@bacteria$ harmful pathogenic organisms @/bacteria$</e13>. Gut health is an important consideration effecting the overall health and wellbeing of linked organ systems. Bioconversion of <e14>@chemical$ dietary flavonoid components @/chemical$</e14> in the <e15>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e15> generates <e16>@chemical$ therapeutic metabolites @/chemical$</e16> that can also be transported by the <e17>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e17> and systemic circulation to brain cell populations to exert a beneficial effect. This is particularly important in a number of <e18>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e18> (<e19>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e19>, <e20>@DDF$ bipolar disorder @/DDF$</e20>, <e21>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e21>, <e22>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e22>) characterized by effects on moods, resulting in <e23>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e23> and <e24>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e24>, <e25>@DDF$ impaired motor function @/DDF$</e25>, and <e26>@DDF$ long-term cognitive decline @/DDF$</e26>. <e27>@chemical$ Native flavonoids @/chemical$</e27> have many beneficial properties in the alleviation of <e28>@DDF$ inflammation in tissues @/DDF$</e28>, however, concerns have been raised that therapeutic levels of <e29>@chemical$ flavonoids @/chemical$</e29> may not be achieved, thus allowing them to display optimal therapeutic effects. <e30>@biomedical technique$ Dietary manipulation @/biomedical technique$</e30> and <e31>@biomedical technique$ vagal stimulation @/biomedical technique$</e31> have both yielded beneficial responses in the treatment of <e32>@DDF$ autism spectrum disorders @/DDF$</e32>, <e33>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e33>, and <e34>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e34>, establishing the <e35>@anatomical location$ vagal nerve @/anatomical location$</e35> as a route of communication in the gut-brain axis with established roles in disease intervention. While a number of <e36>@chemical$ native flavonoids @/chemical$</e36> are beneficial in the treatment of <e37>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e37> and are known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, <e38>@chemical$ microbiome-generated flavonoid metabolites @/chemical$</e38> (e.g., <e39>@chemical$ protocatechuic acid @/chemical$</e39>, <e40>@chemical$ urolithins @/chemical$</e40>, <e41>@chemical$ \u03b3-valerolactones @/chemical$</e41>), which retain the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency of the <e42>@chemical$ native flavonoid @/chemical$</e42> in addition to bioactive properties that promote mitochondrial health and cerebrovascular microcapillary function, should also be considered as potential biotherapeutic agents. Studies are warranted to experimentally examine the efficacy of <e43>@chemical$ flavonoid metabolites @/chemical$</e43> directly, as they emerge as novel therapeutic options."

We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in <e7>@human$ patients @/human$</e7> with <e8>@DDF$ alcohol overconsumption @/DDF$</e8>, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9>, and clinical symptoms. We included <e10>@human$ hospital inpatients @/human$</e10> with a history of <e11>@DDF$ chronic alcohol overconsumption @/DDF$</e11>. For comparison, we included <e12>@human$ control patients @/human$</e12> with a low alcohol intake.

We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of <e24>@bacteria$ Proteobacteria @/bacteria$</e24> and <e25>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e25>, percentage of the <e26>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acid butyrate @/chemical$</e26>, <e27>@DDF$ psychiatric symptoms @/DDF$</e27> (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and biochemical liver variables.

The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of <e7>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e7> (<e8>@chemical$ 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine @/chemical$</e8>) can influence the neurotoxicity in the <e9>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e9> and <e10>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e10>, and the composition of <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> and <e12>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e12> (<e13>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e13>) in feces of <e14>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e14>. <e15>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e15> caused the reduction of <e16>@gene$ dopamine transporter @/gene$</e16> (<e17>@gene$ DAT @/gene$</e17>) and <e18>@gene$ tyrosine hydroxylase @/gene$</e18> (<e19>@gene$ TH @/gene$</e19>) in the <e20>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e20>, and increases in <e21>@gene$ phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein @/gene$</e21> (<e22>@gene$ p-\u03b1-Syn @/gene$</e22>) in the <e23>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e23> and <e24>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e24>. There was a negative correlation between the expression of <e25>@gene$ TH @/gene$</e25> in the <e26>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e26> and the expression of <e27>@gene$ p-\u03b1-Syn @/gene$</e27> in the <e28>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e28>, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. <e29>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e29> caused abnormalities in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity of <e30>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e30> in the <e31>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e31>. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the <e32>@bacteria$ genus Faecalicatena @/bacteria$</e32> in the <e33>@animal$ MPTP-treated group @/animal$</e33> was significantly lower than that of <e34>@animal$ control group @/animal$</e34>. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the <e35>@bacteria$ genus Faecalicatena @/bacteria$</e35> and the expression of <e36>@gene$ TH @/gene$</e36> in the <e37>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e37>. Moreover, <e38>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e38> did not alter the levels of <e39>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e39> in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the <e40>@bacteria$ genus Faecalicatena @/bacteria$</e40> and <e41>@chemical$ propionic acid @/chemical$</e41>. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-\u03b1-Syn expression might be associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the <e42>@anatomical location$ striatum @/anatomical location$</e42> via gut-microbiota-brain axis."

Both genetics and environmental factors influence gut microbiota composition and function. This study examines host-microbe signaling at the <e1>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal barrier @/anatomical location$</e1> to identify bottom-up mechanisms of microbiota-brain communication. We examined differences in gut microbiota composition and fecal miRNA profiles in <e2>@animal$ BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice @/animal$</e2>, in relation to gastrointestinal homeostasis and evaluated the response to perturbation of the <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e3> by <e4>@drug$ broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment @/drug$</e4>. Differences in the gut microbiota composition between <e5>@animal$ BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice @/animal$</e5>, evaluated by <e6>@biomedical technique$ fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e6>, included significant differences in genera <e7>@bacteria$ Prevotella @/bacteria$</e7>, <e8>@bacteria$ Alistipes @/bacteria$</e8>, <e9>@bacteria$ Akkermansia @/bacteria$</e9>, and <e10>@bacteria$ Ruminococcus @/bacteria$</e10>. Significant differences in fecal miRNA profiles were determined using the <e11>@biomedical technique$ nCounter NanoString platform @/biomedical technique$</e11>. A <e12>@biomedical technique$ BLASTn analysis @/biomedical technique$</e12> identified conserved fecal miRNA target regions in bacterial metagenomes with 14 significant correlations found between fecal miRNA and predicted taxa relative abundance in our dataset. Treatment with <e13>@drug$ broad-spectrum antibiotics @/drug$</e13> for 2\u00a0weeks resulted in a host-specific physiological response at the <e14>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal barrier @/anatomical location$</e14> including a decrease in barrier permeability in <e15>@animal$ BALB/c mice @/animal$</e15> and alterations in the expression of <e16>@gene$ barrier regulating genes @/gene$</e16> in both strains. Genera <e17>@bacteria$ Parabacteroides @/bacteria$</e17> and <e18>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e18> were associated with changes in barrier function. The results of this study provide insight into how specific taxa influence gut barrier integrity and function. More generally, these data in the context of recent published studies makes a significant contribution to our understanding of host-microbe interactions providing new knowledge that can be harnessed by us and others in future mechanistic studies."

      "abstract_tagged": "The impact of the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e4> is being increasingly appreciated in health and in various <e5>@DDF$ chronic diseases @/DDF$</e5>, among them <e6>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e6> such as <e7>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e7> (<e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8>). In the pathogenesis of <e9>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e9>, the role of the <e10>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e10> has been previously established. In conjunction with a better understanding of the <e11>@microbiome$ intestinal microbiome @/microbiome$</e11>, a link to the misfolding and spread of <e12>@chemical$ alpha-synuclein @/chemical$</e12> via inflammatory processes within the <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> is discussed. In a case-control study, we assessed the <e14>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e14> of 54 <e15>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e15> and 32 <e16>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e16> (<e17>@human$ HC @/human$</e17>). Additionally, we tested in this proof-of-concept study whether dietary intervention alone or additional physical colon cleaning may lead to changes of the <e18>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e18> in <e19>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e19>. 16 <e20>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e20> underwent a well-controlled balanced, ovo-lacto vegetarian diet intervention including <e21>@chemical$ short fatty acids @/chemical$</e21> for 14 days. 10 of those <e22>@human$ patients @/human$</e22> received additional treatment with daily <e23>@biomedical technique$ fecal enema @/biomedical technique$</e23> over 8 days. Stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of intervention. In comparison to <e24>@human$ HC @/human$</e24>, we could confirm previously reported <e25>@DDF$ PD associated microbiome changes @/DDF$</e25>. The UDPRS III significantly improved and the levodopa-equivalent daily dose decreased after vegetarian diet and <e26>@biomedical technique$ fecal enema @/biomedical technique$</e26> in a one-year follow-up. Additionally, we observed a significant association between the gut microbiome diversity and the UPDRS III and the abundance of <i><e27>@bacteria$ Ruminococcaceae @/bacteria$</e27></i>. Additionally, the abundance of <i><e28>@bacteria$ Clostridiaceae @/bacteria$</e28></i> was significantly reduced after <e29>@biomedical technique$ enema @/biomedical technique$</e29>. Dietary intervention and bowel cleansing may provide an additional non-pharmacologic therapeutic option for <e30>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e30>."

      "abstract_tagged": "Emerging evidence indicates that disruption of the gut microbial community (<e3>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e3>) impairs mental health. <e4>@animal$ Germ-free mice @/animal$</e4> and <e5>@DDF$ antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e5> are two approaches to establish causality in gut microbiota-brain relationships. However, both models have limitations, as <e6>@animal$ germ-free mice @/animal$</e6> display <e7>@DDF$ alterations in blood-brain barrier @/DDF$</e7> and brain ultrastructure and <e8>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e8> may act directly on the <e9>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e9>. We hypothesized that the concerns related to <e10>@DDF$ antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e10> can only adequately be addressed if the effect of intragastric treatment of <e11>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e11> with multiple <e12>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e12> on (i) gut microbial community, (ii) metabolite profile in the <e13>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e13>, (iii) <e14>@chemical$ circulating metabolites @/chemical$</e14>, (iv) expression of <e15>@chemical$ neuronal signaling molecules @/chemical$</e15> in distinct <e16>@anatomical location$ brain areas @/anatomical location$</e16> and (v) cognitive behavior is systematically investigated. Of the <e17>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e17> used (<e18>@drug$ ampicillin @/drug$</e18>, <e19>@drug$ bacitracin @/drug$</e19>, <e20>@drug$ meropenem @/drug$</e20>, <e21>@drug$ neomycin @/drug$</e21>, <e22>@drug$ vancomycin @/drug$</e22>), <e23>@drug$ ampicillin @/drug$</e23> had some oral bioavailability but did not enter the <e24>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e24>. <e25>@biomedical technique$ 16S rDNA sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e25> confirmed <e26>@DDF$ antibiotic-induced microbial community disruption @/DDF$</e26>, and <e27>@biomedical technique$ metabolomics @/biomedical technique$</e27> revealed that <e28>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e28> was associated with <e29>@DDF$ depletion of bacteria-derived metabolites @/DDF$</e29> in the <e30>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e30> and <e31>@DDF$ alterations of lipid species and converted microbe-derived molecules @/DDF$</e31> in the plasma. Importantly, novel object recognition, but not spatial, memory was impaired in <e32>@animal$ antibiotic-treated mice @/animal$</e32>. This <e33>@DDF$ cognitive deficit @/DDF$</e33> was associated with brain region-specific changes in the expression of <e34>@chemical$ cognition-relevant signaling molecules @/chemical$</e34>, notably <e35>@chemical$ brain-derived neurotrophic factor @/chemical$</e35>, <e36>@chemical$ N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B @/chemical$</e36>, <e37>@chemical$ serotonin transporter @/chemical$</e37> and <e38>@chemical$ neuropeptide Y system @/chemical$</e38>. We conclude that <e39>@chemical$ circulating metabolites @/chemical$</e39> and the <e40>@chemical$ cerebral neuropeptide Y system @/chemical$</e40> play an important role in the <e41>@DDF$ cognitive impairment @/DDF$</e41> and <e42>@DDF$ dysregulation of cerebral signaling molecules @/DDF$</e42> due to <e43>@DDF$ antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e43>."

To investigate how <e8>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e8> alter the physiological and psychological changes induced by <e9>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e9>, we tested the performance of <e10>@animal$ ampicillin-treated rats @/animal$</e10> in the presence or absence of <e11>@dietary supplement$ Lactobacillus fermentum strain NS9 @/dietary supplement$</e11>, in <e12>@biomedical technique$ elevated plus maze @/biomedical technique$</e12> and <e13>@biomedical technique$ Morris water maze @/biomedical technique$</e13>. The results showed that <e14>@dietary supplement$ NS9 @/dietary supplement$</e14> normalised the composition of <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e15> and alleviated the <e16>@DDF$ ampicillin-induced inflammation @/DDF$</e16> in the <e17>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e17>. The levels of the <e18>@chemical$ mineralocorticoid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors @/chemical$</e18> were also elevated in the <e19>@anatomical location$ hippocampus @/anatomical location$</e19> of the <e20>@animal$ ampillicin+NS9 treated group @/animal$</e20>. NS9 administration also reduced the <e21>@DDF$ anxiety-like behaviour @/DDF$</e21> and alleviated the <e22>@DDF$ ampicillin-induced impairment @/DDF$</e22> in memory retention. These findings suggest that <e23>@dietary supplement$ NS9 @/dietary supplement$</e23> is beneficial to the host, because it restores the <e24>@DDF$ physiological and psychological abnormalities @/DDF$</e24> induced by <e25>@drug$ ampicillin @/drug$</e25>. Our results highlight how gut contents regulate the <e26>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e26>, and shed light on the clinical applications of <e27>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e27> to treat the side effect of <e28>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e28> and <e29>@DDF$ mental disorders @/DDF$</e29>."

We present the first systematic review of the <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> in <e9>@DDF$ anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e9>, along with an update in <e10>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e10>. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> in <e12>@DDF$ generalised anxiety disorder @/DDF$</e12>, 18 in <e13>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e13>, one incorporating both <e14>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e14>/<e15>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e15>, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of <e16>@bacteria$ proinflammatory species @/bacteria$</e16> (e.g., <e17>@bacteria$ Enterobacteriaceae @/bacteria$</e17> and <e18>@bacteria$ Desulfovibrio @/bacteria$</e18>), and lower <e19>@bacteria$ short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria @/bacteria$</e19> (e.g., <e20>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e20>). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of <e21>@DDF$ peripheral inflammation @/DDF$</e21> to the <e22>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e22>. Although the <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23> remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and <e24>@drug$ psychotropic medications @/drug$</e24>, and should examine microorganism function."

      "abstract_tagged": "Braak's hypothesis states that <e4>@DDF$ sporadic Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e4> (<e5>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e5>) follows a specific progression of pathology from the peripheral to the central nervous system, and this progression can be monitored by detecting the\u00a0accumulation of <e6>@chemical$ alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) protein @/chemical$</e6>. Consequently, there is\u00a0growing interest in understanding how the <e7>@microbiome$ gut (commensal) microbiome @/microbiome$</e7> can regulate <e8>@chemical$ \u03b1-Syn @/chemical$</e8> accumulation, as this could potentially lead to <e9>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e9>. We used <e10>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e10> to characterise microbial diversity. <e11>@biomedical technique$ <sup>1</sup>H-NMR @/biomedical technique$</e11> was employed to understand the metabolite\u00a0production and <e12>@DDF$ intestinal inflammation @/DDF$</e12> estimated using <e13>@biomedical technique$ ELISA @/biomedical technique$</e13> and <e14>@biomedical technique$ RNA-sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e14> from feces and the\u00a0<e15>@anatomical location$ intestinal epithelial layer @/anatomical location$</e15> respectively. The\u00a0Na<sup>+</sup> channel current and gut permeability were measured using an\u00a0<e16>@biomedical technique$ Ussing chamber @/biomedical technique$</e16>. <e17>@biomedical technique$ Immunohistochemistry @/biomedical technique$</e17> and <e18>@biomedical technique$ immunofluorescence imaging @/biomedical technique$</e18> were applied to detect the\u00a0<e19>@chemical$ \u03b1-Syn protein @/chemical$</e19>. <e20>@biomedical technique$ LC-MS/MS @/biomedical technique$</e20> was used for characterization of <e21>@chemical$ proteins @/chemical$</e21> from metabolite treated neuronal cells. Finally, Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tools were used for identification of <e22>@DDF$ dysregulated pathways @/DDF$</e22>. We studied a transgenic (TG) rat model overexpressing the <e23>@gene$ human SNCA gene @/gene$</e23> and found that a progressive gut microbial composition alteration characterized by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in the <e24>@animal$ young TG rats @/animal$</e24>. Interestingly, this ratio then increased with ageing. The\u00a0dynamics of <e25>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e25> and <e26>@bacteria$ Alistipes @/bacteria$</e26> were monitored and reduced Lactobacillus and increased Alistipes abundance was discerned in <e27>@animal$ ageing TG rats @/animal$</e27>. Additionally, the SNCA gene overexpression resulted in gut \u03b1-Syn protein expression and increased with advanced age. Further, <e28>@animal$ older TG animals @/animal$</e28> had increased <e29>@DDF$ intestinal inflammation @/DDF$</e29>, <e30>@DDF$ decreased Na<sup>+</sup> current @/DDF$</e30> and a <e31>@DDF$ robust alteration in metabolite production @/DDF$</e31> characterized by the <e32>@DDF$ increase of succinate levels in feces and serum @/DDF$</e32>. Manipulation of the <e33>@bacteria$ gut bacteria @/bacteria$</e33> by <e34>@drug$ short-term antibiotic cocktail\u00a0treatment @/drug$</e34> revealed a complete loss of <e35>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e35> and a\u00a0reduction in succinate levels. Although <e36>@drug$ antibiotic\u00a0cocktail treatment @/drug$</e36> did not change \u03b1-Syn expression in the <e37>@anatomical location$ enteric nervous system of the colon @/anatomical location$</e37>, however, reduced \u03b1-Syn expression was detected in the <e38>@anatomical location$ olfactory bulbs @/anatomical location$</e38> (<e39>@anatomical location$ forebrain @/anatomical location$</e39>) of the <e40>@animal$ TG rats @/animal$</e40>. Our data emphasize that the <e41>@DDF$ gut microbiome dysbiosis @/DDF$</e41> synchronous with ageing leads to a specific alteration of <e42>@chemical$ gut metabolites @/chemical$</e42> and can be modulated by <e43>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e43> which may affect <e44>@DDF$ PD pathology @/DDF$</e44>."

Emerging evidence highlights the connection between <e7>@DDF$ microbiota alterations @/DDF$</e7> and <e8>@DDF$ neurological and psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e8>, including <e9>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e9>. This review explores the potential of <e10>@dietary supplement$ psychobiotics @/dietary supplement$</e10> in managing <e11>@DDF$ depressive disorders @/DDF$</e11>, emphasizing their role in restoring microbial balance and influencing the MGB axis. <e12>@dietary supplement$ Psychobiotics @/dietary supplement$</e12> exhibit positive effects on the intestinal barrier, immune response, cortisol levels, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies suggest that <e13>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e13> may serve as an adjunct therapy for <e14>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e14>, especially in treatment-resistant cases. This review discusses key findings from studies on <e15>@dietary supplement$ psychobiotics interventions @/dietary supplement$</e15>, emphasizing their impact on the gut-brain axis and mental health. The increasing acceptance of the expanded concept of the MGB axis underscores the importance of microorganisms in mental well-being. As our understanding of the microbiome's role in health and disease grows, <e16>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e16> emerge as promising agents for addressing <e17>@DDF$ mental health issues @/DDF$</e17>, providing new avenues for therapeutic interventions in <e18>@DDF$ depressive disorders @/DDF$</e18>."

Clinical symptoms and neuropathology have suggested that <e5>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e5> may originate in the <e6>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e6>, which is home to approximately 100 trillion microbes. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota populations may promote the development and progression of <e7>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e7>. Here, we reviewed existing studies that have explored the role of <e8>@DDF$ intestinal dysbiosis @/DDF$</e8> in <e9>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e9>, focusing on the roles of microbiota, their metabolites, and components in <e10>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e10>, <e11>@DDF$ barrier failure @/DDF$</e11>, <e12>@DDF$ microglial activation @/DDF$</e12>, and <e13>@DDF$ \u03b1-synuclein pathology @/DDF$</e13>. We conclude that there are <e14>@DDF$ intestinal dysbiosis @/DDF$</e14> in <e15>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e15>. <e16>@DDF$ Intestinal dysbiosis @/DDF$</e16> is likely involved in the pathogenesis of <e17>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e17> through mechanisms that include <e18>@DDF$ barrier destruction @/DDF$</e18>, <e19>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e19> and <e20>@DDF$ oxidative stress @/DDF$</e20>, decreased dopamine production, and molecular mimicry. Additional studies remain necessary to explore and verify the mechanisms through which <e21>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e21> may cause or promote <e22>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e22>. Preclinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal microbial therapy may represent an effective and novel treatment for <e23>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e23>; however, more studies, especially clinical studies, are necessary to explore the curative effects of microbial therapy in <e24>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e24>."

For differential diagnosis and preventive treatment, there is an urgent need for the identification of biomarkers indicating early disease stages long before the disease phenotype manifests. <e11>@chemical$ DJ-1 @/chemical$</e11> is a chaperone protein involved in the protection against <e12>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e12> and genetic mutations in this protein have been shown to cause <e13>@DDF$ familial PD @/DDF$</e13>. However, how the deficiency of <e14>@chemical$ DJ-1 @/chemical$</e14> influences the risk of <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15> remains incompletely understood.

Further, <e28>@gene$ inflammatory genes @/gene$</e28> related to <e29>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e29> were augmented in the <e30>@anatomical location$ midbrain @/anatomical location$</e30> of <e31>@animal$ DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice @/animal$</e31>. Our data suggest that metabolites and <e32>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e32> produced in the <e33>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e33> could be used as biomarkers for PD detection.

      "abstract_tagged": "<e5>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e5>, a brain-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6>. Considering the role of microglia and <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> in the brain homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of <e8>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e8> (65\u00a0mg/kg/day for consecutive 7\u00a0days) could affect the composition of <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9> and the concentration of <e10>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e10> (<e11>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e11>) in fresh feces of <e12>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e12>. Repeated administration of <e13>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e13> caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the <e14>@anatomical location$ prefrontal cortex @/anatomical location$</e14> (<e15>@anatomical location$ PFC @/anatomical location$</e15>) and <e16>@anatomical location$ hippocampus @/anatomical location$</e16> compared to <e17>@animal$ control mice @/animal$</e17> although the elimination of <e18>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e18>'s microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the \u03b2-diversity of <e19>@microbiome$ intestine microbiota @/microbiome$</e19> in the <e20>@animal$ PLX5622-treated group @/animal$</e20>. <e21>@statistical technique$ Linear discriminant analysis effect size @/statistical technique$</e21> identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for <e22>@animal$ PLX5622-treated group @/animal$</e22>. Repeated administration of <e23>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e23> affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of <e24>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e24> caused a significant change in <e25>@chemical$ lactic acid @/chemical$</e25> compared to <e26>@animal$ control group @/animal$</e26>. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the <e27>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e27> and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the brain-gut axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of <e28>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e28> leads to an abnormal composition of the <e29>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e29> and <e30>@chemical$ lactic acid @/chemical$</e30> in <e31>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e31>. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of <e32>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e32> after repeated treatment of <e33>@drug$ PLX5622 @/drug$</e33> should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with <e34>@drug$ CSF1R inhibitors @/drug$</e34>."

In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of <e6>@food$ unpasteurised dairy @/food$</e6> on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in <e7>@human$ participants @/human$</e7> undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm. Twenty-four <e8>@human$ participants @/human$</e8> completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included <e9>@food$ unpasteurised milk @/food$</e9> and <e10>@food$ dairy products @/food$</e10>. At the beginning and end of the course, <e11>@human$ participants @/human$</e11> provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, <e12>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e12> and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with <e13>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13>. Additionally, <e14>@chemical$ faecal short chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e14> (<e15>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e15>) were measured. Relative abundance of the genus <i><e16>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e16></i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of <e17>@food$ unpasteurised milk @/food$</e17> and <e18>@food$ dairy products @/food$</e18>. An increase in the <e19>@chemical$ faecal SCFA @/chemical$</e19>, <e20>@chemical$ valerate @/chemical$</e20>, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut-brain module approach. While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of <e21>@food$ unpasteurised milk @/food$</e21> and <e22>@food$ dairy products @/food$</e22> appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i><e23>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e23></i>, in the <e24>@anatomical location$ human gut @/anatomical location$</e24>. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i><e25>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e25></i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes."

In the past 7 years, we have studied the role of microbiota-brain communication on behavior in mouse models using <e2>@animal$ germ-free mice @/animal$</e2>, <e3>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e3> exposed to <e4>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e4>, and <e5>@animal$ healthy specific pathogen free mice @/animal$</e5>. Through our work and that of others, we have seen an amazing increase in our knowledge of how bacteria signal to the <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> and the implications this has for psychiatry. Gut microbiota composition and function are influenced both by genetics, age, sex, diet, life experiences, and many other factors of <e7>@DDF$ psychiatric and bodily disorders @/DDF$</e7> and thus may act as potential biomarkers of the gut-brain axis that could be used in psychiatry and <e8>@DDF$ co-morbid conditions @/DDF$</e8>. There is a particular need in <e9>@DDF$ major depressive disorder @/DDF$</e9> and other <e10>@DDF$ mental illness @/DDF$</e10> to identify biomarkers that can stratify <e11>@human$ patients @/human$</e11> into more homogeneous groups to provide better treatment and for development of new therapeutic approaches. Peripheral outcome measures of host-microbe bidirectional communication have significant translational value as biomarkers. Enabling stratification of <e12>@human$ clinical populations @/human$</e12>, based on individual biological differences, to predict treatment response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Here we consider the links between <e13>@DDF$ co-morbid metabolic syndrome @/DDF$</e13> and <e14>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e14>, focusing on biomarkers including <e15>@chemical$ leptin @/chemical$</e15> and <e16>@chemical$ ghrelin @/chemical$</e16> in combination with assessing gut microbiota composition, as a potential tool to help identify individual differences in <e17>@human$ depressed population @/human$</e17>."

The <e13>@human$ MDD group @/human$</e13> received individualized treatment with <e14>@drug$ escitalopram @/drug$</e14> at a maximum dose of 20\u00a0mg/day. After depressive symptoms improved to a HAMD scale score\u2009>\u200950%, a fecal sample was collected again and used as the follow-up group.

The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly different within three groups, and the ratio of follow-up group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in <e19>@human$ MDD group @/human$</e19> than those of the other groups, and the alpha diversity was not significantly different between <e20>@human$ control and follow-up groups @/human$</e20>.

The metabolic function of <e24>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e24> after treatment was still different from that of the <e25>@human$ control group @/human$</e25>.

We analyze the <e20>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e20>, motor behavior, and <e21>@DDF$ gastrointestinal and brain pathologies @/DDF$</e21>. We find that diet and <e22>@chemical$ bacterial curli @/chemical$</e22> alter the microbiome and exacerbate motor performance, as well as <e23>@DDF$ intestinal and brain pathologies @/DDF$</e23>, but to different extents. Our results shed important insights on how diet and microbiome-borne insults modulate PD progression via the gut-brain axis and have implications for lifestyle management of <e24>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e24>."

The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional communication system between the <e1>@anatomical location$ central nervous system @/anatomical location$</e1> (<e2>@anatomical location$ CNS @/anatomical location$</e2>) and the <e3>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e3>. Regulation of the microbiota-brain-gut axis is essential for maintaining homeostasis, including that of the <e4>@anatomical location$ CNS @/anatomical location$</e4>. The routes of this communication are not fully elucidated but include neural, humoral, immune, and metabolic pathways. A number of approaches have been used to interrogate this axis including the use of <e5>@animal$ germ-free animals @/animal$</e5>, <e6>@dietary supplement$ probiotic agents @/dietary supplement$</e6>, <e7>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e7>, or <e8>@animal$ animals @/animal$</e8> exposed to <e9>@DDF$ pathogenic bacterial infections @/DDF$</e9>. Together, it is clear that the <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e10> can be a key regulator of mood, cognition, pain, and <e11>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e11>. Understanding microbiota-brain interactions is an exciting area of research which may contribute new insights into individual variations in cognition, personality, mood, sleep, and eating behavior, and how they contribute to a range of <e12>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric diseases @/DDF$</e12> ranging from <e13>@DDF$ affective disorders @/DDF$</e13> to <e14>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ schizophrenia @/DDF$</e15>. Finally, the concept of <e16>@dietary supplement$ psychobiotics @/dietary supplement$</e16>, bacterial-based interventions with mental health benefit, is also emerging."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e3>@DDF$ Schizophrenia @/DDF$</e3> (<e4>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e4>) is a <e5>@DDF$ psychiatric disorder @/DDF$</e5> that constitutes one of the top 10 global causes of disability. More recently, a potential pathogenic role for the gut microbial community (microbiota) has been highlighted, with numerous studies describing dysregulated microbial profiles in <e6>@human$ SZ patients @/human$</e6> when compared to <e7>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e7>. However, no animal model of <e8>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e8> has previously recapitulated the <e9>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e9> observed clinically. Since the <e10>@animal$ metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) knockout mice @/animal$</e10> provide a preclinical model of <e11>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e11> with strong face and predictive validity, in the present study we performed gut microbiome profiling of <e12>@animal$ mGlu5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice @/animal$</e12> by <e13>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13> of bacterial genomic DNA from fecal samples, analyzing bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition, as well as gastrointestinal parameters as indicators of gut function. We found a significant genotype difference in microbial beta diversity. <e14>@biomedical technique$ Analysis of composition of microbiomes @/biomedical technique$</e14> (<e15>@biomedical technique$ ANCOM @/biomedical technique$</e15>) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions, which identified a decreased relative abundance of the <e16>@bacteria$ <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> family @/bacteria$</e16> and <e17>@bacteria$ <i>Allobaculum</i> genus @/bacteria$</e17> in this mouse model of <e18>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e18>. We also identified a signature of bacteria discriminating between the genotypes (KO and WT), consisting of the <e19>@bacteria$ Erysipelotrichales @/bacteria$</e19>, <e20>@bacteria$ Bacteroidales @/bacteria$</e20>, and <e21>@bacteria$ Clostridiales @/bacteria$</e21> orders and macroscopic gut differences. We thus uncovered global differential community composition in the gut microbiota profile between <e22>@animal$ mGlu5 KO and WT mice @/animal$</e22>, outlining the first evidence for <e23>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e23> in a genetic animal model of <e24>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e24>. Our findings suggest that this widely used preclinical model of <e25>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e25> also has substantial utility for investigations of <e26>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e26> and associated signaling via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, as potential modulators of <e27>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e27> pathogenesis. Our discovery opens up new avenues to explore <e28>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e28> and its proposed links to <e29>@DDF$ brain dysfunction @/DDF$</e29> in <e30>@DDF$ SZ @/DDF$</e30>, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disorder."

In particular, <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e3> influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the <e4>@microbiome$ intestinal flora @/microbiome$</e4> through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of <e5>@human$ healthy subjects @/human$</e5>. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of <e6>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e6>, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. <e7>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e7> and <e8>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e8>) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as <e9>@DDF$ autism spectrum disorders @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e10> (e.g. <e11>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e11> and <e12>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e12>). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including <e13>@drug$ neuropsychiatric drugs @/drug$</e13>. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the <e14>@microbiome$ human gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development."

Although the currently available <e5>@drug$ antidepressants @/drug$</e5> have been used in the treatment of <e6>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e6>, their beneficial effects are limited. Accumulating evidence suggests that <e7>@gene$ pro-inflammatory cytokines @/gene$</e7> such as <e8>@gene$ interleukin-6 @/gene$</e8> (<e9>@gene$ IL-6 @/gene$</e9>) have an important role in the pathogenesis of <e10>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e10>. This study was undertaken to examine whether <e11>@chemical$ anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody @/chemical$</e11> (<e12>@chemical$ MR16-1 @/chemical$</e12>) induces antidepressant effects in a social defeat stress model. Intravenous injection of <e13>@chemical$ MR16-1 @/chemical$</e13> induced rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects in <e14>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e14> after <e15>@DDF$ social defeat stress @/DDF$</e15> through its anti-inflammatory actions. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of <e16>@chemical$ MR16-1 @/chemical$</e16> induced no antidepressant effects in <e17>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e17>. Furthermore, treatment with <e18>@chemical$ MR16-1 @/chemical$</e18> could significantly normalize alterations in the expression of <e19>@chemical$ synaptic proteins @/chemical$</e19> (<e20>@chemical$ postsynaptic density protein 95 @/chemical$</e20> and <e21>@chemical$ \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 1 @/chemical$</e21>) and dendritic spine density in the <e22>@anatomical location$ brain regions @/anatomical location$</e22> of <e23>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e23>. Gut microbiota analysis using <e24>@biomedical technique$ 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e24> showed that <e25>@chemical$ MR16-1 @/chemical$</e25> significantly improved decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in <e26>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e26>. It also significantly improved decreased levels of <e27>@bacteria$ Oscillospira @/bacteria$</e27> in <e28>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e28>. These findings suggest that <e29>@gene$ peripheral IL-6 @/gene$</e29> has a key role in the pathogenesis of <e30>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e30> and that the blockade of <e31>@chemical$ IL-6 receptor @/chemical$</e31> in the <e32>@anatomical location$ periphery @/anatomical location$</e32> might have rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects by normalizing the altered composition of <e33>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e33> in <e34>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e34> after <e35>@DDF$ social defeat stress @/DDF$</e35>. Therefore, the blockade of <e36>@chemical$ IL-6 receptor @/chemical$</e36> in the <e37>@anatomical location$ periphery @/anatomical location$</e37> shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for <e38>@human$ depressed patients @/human$</e38> with higher IL-6 blood levels."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e4>@DDF$ Neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e4> plays a significant role in <e5>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology @/DDF$</e5> along with <e6>@DDF$ mitochondrial dysfunction @/DDF$</e6> and <e7>@DDF$ impaired proteostasis @/DDF$</e7>. In this context, mechanisms related to immune response can act as modifiers at different steps of the neurodegenerative process and justify the growing interest in <e8>@drug$ anti-inflammatory agents @/drug$</e8> as potential disease-modifying treatments in <e9>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e9>. The discovery of inherited gene mutations in <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10> has allowed researchers to develop cellular and animal models to study the mechanisms of the underlying biology, but the original cause of <e11>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e11> in <e12>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e12> is still debated to date. <e13>@DDF$ Cell autonomous alterations @/DDF$</e13> in neuronal cells, including <e14>@DDF$ mitochondrial damage @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ protein aggregation @/DDF$</e15>, could play a role, but recent findings also highlighted the importance of intercellular communication at both local and systemic level. This has given rise to debate about the role of non-neuronal cells in <e16>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e16> and reignited intense research into the gut-brain axis and other non-neuronal interactions in the development of the disease. Whatever the original trigger of <e17>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e17> in <e18>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e18>, what appears quite clear is that the aberrant activation of glial cells and other components of the immune system creates a vicious circle in which <e19>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e19> and <e20>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e20> nourish each other. In this review, we will provide an up-to-date summary of the main cellular alterations underlying <e21>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e21> in <e22>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e22>, including those induced by environmental factors (e.g. the <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e23>) and those related to the genetic background of <e24>@human$ affected patients @/human$</e24>. Starting from the lesson provided by familial forms of <e25>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e25>, we will discuss pathophysiological mechanisms linked to <e26>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e26> that could also play a role in idiopathic forms. Finally, we will comment on the potential clinical translatability of immunobiomarkers identified in <e27>@human$ PD patient cohorts @/human$</e27> and provide an update on current therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming or preventing <e28>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e28> in <e29>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e29>."

      "abstract_tagged": "Relations between the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14\u00a0years of life and explored its relations to <e5>@DDF$ internalizing and externalizing difficulties @/DDF$</e5> and <e6>@DDF$ social anxiety @/DDF$</e6> in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of <e7>@DDF$ mental health problems @/DDF$</e7>. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by <e8>@biomedical technique$ 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e8> in a total of 1003 samples from 193 <e9>@human$ children @/human$</e9>. Through a <e10>@statistical technique$ clustering method @/statistical technique$</e10>, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most <e11>@human$ children within three of these clusters @/human$</e11> remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14\u00a0years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> based on its composition across different populations) enriched in <e13>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e13>, <e14>@bacteria$ Prevotella @/bacteria$</e14>, and <e15>@bacteria$ Ruminococcus @/bacteria$</e15>, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with <e16>@DDF$ more externalizing behavior @/DDF$</e16> at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more <e17>@DDF$ social anxiety @/DDF$</e17> at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between <e18>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e18> and <e19>@DDF$ social anxiety @/DDF$</e19> in the <e20>@human$ 14-year-olds @/human$</e20>. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that <e21>@bacteria$ Prevotella 9 @/bacteria$</e21> and <e22>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e22> may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to <e23>@DDF$ externalizing behavior @/DDF$</e23> and <e24>@DDF$ social anxiety @/DDF$</e24>, respectively. These correlational findings need validations from other similar cohort studies, as well as well-designed mechanistic pre-clinical investigations before inferring cause and effect."

Recent research has positioned the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> as an important susceptibility factor in <e7>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e7> by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of <e8>@human$ Alzheimer's patients @/human$</e8> and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether <e9>@DDF$ gut microbiota alterations @/DDF$</e9> are causal in the manifestation of <e10>@DDF$ Alzheimer's symptoms @/DDF$</e10>. To understand the involvement of <e11>@microbiome$ Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted <e12>@microbiome$ faecal microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> from <e13>@human$ Alzheimer's patients @/human$</e13> and <e14>@human$ age-matched healthy controls @/human$</e14> into <e15>@animal$ microbiota-depleted young adult rats @/animal$</e15>. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in <e16>@human$ donor patients @/human$</e16>. Discrete changes in the <e17>@chemical$ rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome @/chemical$</e17> were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in <e18>@human$ living humans @/human$</e18> but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from <e19>@human$ Alzheimer's patients @/human$</e19> decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that <e20>@DDF$ Alzheimer's symptoms @/DDF$</e20> can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e21>, confirming a causal role of <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e22> in <e23>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e23>, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in <e24>@DDF$ Alzheimer's @/DDF$</e24>."

Transplantation of the \"<e26>@microbiome$ SD microbiota @/microbiome$</e26>\" into <e27>@animal$ GF mice @/animal$</e27> activated the <e28>@chemical$ Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-\u03baB @/chemical$</e28> signaling pathway and impaired <e29>@DDF$ cognitive function @/DDF$</e29> in the <e30>@animal$ recipient mice @/animal$</e30>. <e31>@animal$ Mice @/animal$</e31> that harbored \"<e32>@microbiome$ SD microbiota @/microbiome$</e32>\" also exhibited increases in <e33>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e33> and microglial activity in the <e34>@anatomical location$ hippocampus @/anatomical location$</e34> and <e35>@anatomical location$ medial prefrontal cortex @/anatomical location$</e35>. These findings indicate that <e36>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e36> contributes to both peripheral and central inflammatory processes and <e37>@DDF$ cognitive deficits @/DDF$</e37> that are induced by <e38>@DDF$ SD @/DDF$</e38>, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of <e39>@DDF$ sleep loss @/DDF$</e39>."

We previously reported that the new antidepressant <e8>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e8> improved the <e9>@DDF$ reduced BMD @/DDF$</e9> seen in <e10>@animal$ chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) susceptible mice @/animal$</e10> and <e11>@animal$ ovariectomized mice @/animal$</e11>. Considering the role of the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> in maintaining bone health, the current study investigated whether the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13>, along with metabolites derived from the microbiome, play a role in the beneficial actions of <e14>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e14> with respect to the <e15>@DDF$ anhedonia-like behavior @/DDF$</e15> and <e16>@DDF$ reduced BMD @/DDF$</e16> seen in <e17>@animal$ CSDS susceptible mice @/animal$</e17>. A single administration of <e18>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e18> (10\u00a0mg/kg) ameliorated <e19>@DDF$ anhedonia-like behavior @/DDF$</e19> and <e20>@DDF$ decreased femoral neck cortical (and total) BMD @/DDF$</e20> in <e21>@animal$ CSDS susceptible mice @/animal$</e21>. There was a negative correlation between <e22>@DDF$ anhedonia-like behavior @/DDF$</e22> and BMD. Furthermore, significant differences in the abundance of <e23>@microbiome$ microbiota @/microbiome$</e23> (and <e24>@chemical$ plasma metabolites @/chemical$</e24>) were found between the <e25>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e25>\u00a0+\u00a0<e26>@chemical$ saline @/chemical$</e26> and <e27>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e27>\u00a0+\u00a0<e28>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e28> groups. Correlations were observed between the abundance of certain <e29>@microbiome$ microbiota @/microbiome$</e29> (and <e30>@chemical$ plasma metabolites @/chemical$</e30>) and cortical (and total) BMD. These data suggest that, in addition to its anti-anhedonia effect, <e31>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e31> might ameliorate the <e32>@DDF$ reduced cortical (and total) BMD @/DDF$</e32> seen in <e33>@animal$ CSDS susceptible mice @/animal$</e33> through the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis. Therefore, <e34>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e34> could serve as a drug therapy for <e35>@human$ depressed patients @/human$</e35> with <e36>@DDF$ low BMD @/DDF$</e36>.

      "abstract_tagged": "<e6>@drug$ Minocycline @/drug$</e6> is a clinically available synthetic tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. The majority of studies show that <e7>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e7> can reduce tissue damage and improve functional recovery following <e8>@DDF$ central nervous system injuries @/DDF$</e8>, mainly attributed to the drug's direct anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties. Surprisingly the consequences of <e9>@drug$ minocycline's antibiotic @/drug$</e9> (i.e., antibacterial) effects on the <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e10> and systemic immune response after <e11>@DDF$ spinal cord injury @/DDF$</e11> have largely been ignored despite their links to changes in mental health and <e12>@DDF$ immune suppression @/DDF$</e12>. Here, we sought to determine minocycline's effect on spinal cord injury-induced changes in the microbiota-immune axis using a <e13>@DDF$ cervical contusion injury @/DDF$</e13> in <e14>@animal$ female Lewis rats @/animal$</e14>. We investigated a group that received <e15>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e15> following <e16>@DDF$ spinal cord injury @/DDF$</e16> (immediately after injury for 7\u2009days), an untreated spinal cord injury group, an untreated uninjured group, and an uninjured group that received <e17>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e17>. Plasma levels of <e18>@chemical$ cytokines/chemokines @/chemical$</e18> and fecal microbiota composition (using <e19>@biomedical technique$ 16s rRNA sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e19>) were monitored for 4\u2009weeks following <e20>@DDF$ spinal cord injury @/DDF$</e20> as measures of the microbiota-immune axis. Additionally, motor recovery and <e21>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e21> were assessed throughout the study, and microglial activation was analyzed immediately rostral to, caudal to, and at the lesion epicenter. We found that <e22>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e22> had a profound acute effect on the microbiota diversity and composition, which was paralleled by the subsequent normalization of spinal cord injury-induced suppression of <e23>@chemical$ cytokines/chemokines @/chemical$</e23>. Importantly, <e24>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e24> following <e25>@DDF$ spinal cord injury @/DDF$</e25> has been linked to the development of <e26>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e26>, which was also decreased by <e27>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e27>. Furthermore, although <e28>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e28> attenuated <e29>@DDF$ spinal cord injury-induced @/DDF$</e29> microglial activation, it did not affect the lesion size or promote measurable motor recovery. We show that minocycline's microbiota effects precede its long-term effects on <e30>@chemical$ systemic cytokines and chemokines @/chemical$</e30> following <e31>@DDF$ spinal cord injury @/DDF$</e31>. These results provide an exciting new target of <e32>@drug$ minocycline @/drug$</e32> as a therapeutic for <e33>@DDF$ central nervous system diseases @/DDF$</e33> and injuries."

      "abstract_tagged": "Blood in healthy organisms is seen as a 'sterile' environment: it lacks proliferating microbes. Dormant or not-immediately-culturable forms are not absent, however, as intracellular dormancy is well established. We highlight here that a great many pathogens can survive in blood and inside erythrocytes. 'Non-culturability', reflected by discrepancies between plate counts and total counts, is commonplace in environmental microbiology. It is overcome by improved culturing methods, and we asked how common this would be in blood. A number of recent, <e3>@biomedical technique$ sequence-based and ultramicroscopic studies @/biomedical technique$</e3> have uncovered an authentic <e4>@microbiome$ blood microbiome @/microbiome$</e4> in a number of <e5>@DDF$ non-communicable diseases @/DDF$</e5>. The chief origin of these microbes is the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e6> (especially when it shifts composition to a pathogenic state, known as '<e7>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e7>'). Another source is microbes translocated from the <e8>@anatomical location$ oral cavity @/anatomical location$</e8>. '<e9>@DDF$ Dysbiosis @/DDF$</e9>' is also used to describe translocation of cells into blood or other tissues. To avoid ambiguity, we here use the term 'atopobiosis' for microbes that appear in places other than their normal location. Atopobiosis may contribute to the dynamics of a variety of <e10>@DDF$ inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e10>. Overall, it seems that many more <e11>@DDF$ chronic, non-communicable, inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e11> may have a microbial component than are presently considered, and may be treatable using <e12>@drug$ bactericidal antibiotics @/drug$</e12> or <e13>@drug$ vaccines @/drug$</e13>."
