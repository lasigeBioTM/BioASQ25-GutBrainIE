The <e5>@gene$ Escherichia coli functional amyloid CsgA @/gene$</e5> is known to accelerate \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in\u00a0vitro and induce <e6>@DDF$ PD symptoms @/DDF$</e6> in <e7>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e7>. However, the mechanism governing CsgA-mediated acceleration of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that <e8>@gene$ CsgA @/gene$</e8> can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster \u03b1-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new <e9>@gene$ CsgA homologs @/gene$</e9> encoded by bacteria present in the <e10>@microbiome$ human microbiome @/microbiome$</e10>. These <e11>@gene$ CsgA homologs @/gene$</e11> display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to an increased acceleration of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of <e12>@gene$ gut bacterial CsgA homologs @/gene$</e12> affects their ability to accelerate \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between <e13>@gene$ CsgA @/gene$</e13> and \u03b1-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and \u03b1-synuclein that better informs our understanding of <e14>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e14> causation."

The pooled analyses showed that <e33>@human$ children @/human$</e33> with <e34>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e34> had significantly lower levels of <e35>@chemical$ oxytocin @/chemical$</e35> (mean differences, MD\u2009=\u2009-45.691, 95% confidence interval, CI: -61.667, -29.717), <e36>@chemical$ iron @/chemical$</e36> (MD\u2009=\u2009-3.203, 95% CI: -4.891, -1.514), and <e37>@chemical$ zinc @/chemical$</e37> (MD\u2009=\u2009-6.707, 95% CI: -12.691, -0.722), lower relative abundance of <i><e38>@bacteria$ Bifidobacterium @/bacteria$</e38></i> (MD\u2009=\u2009-1.321, 95% CI: -2.403, -0.238) and <i><e39>@bacteria$ Parabacteroides @/bacteria$</e39></i> (MD\u2009=\u2009-0.081, 95% CI: -0.148, -0.013), higher levels of <e40>@chemical$ c-reactive protein @/chemical$</e40>, <e41>@chemical$ CRP @/chemical$</e41> (MD\u2009=\u20090.401, 95% CI: 0.036, 0.772), and <e42>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e42> (MD\u2009=\u20090.115, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.186), and higher relative abundance of <i><e43>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e43></i> (MD\u2009=\u20091.386, 95% CI: 0.717, 2.055) and <i><e44>@bacteria$ Clostridium @/bacteria$</e44></i> (MD\u2009=\u20090.281, 95% CI: 0.035, 0.526) when compared with controls. The results of the overall analyses were stable after performing the <e45>@statistical technique$ sensitivity analyses @/statistical technique$</e45>. Additionally, no substantial publication bias was observed among the studies. <e46>@human$ Children @/human$</e46> with <e47>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e47> have significantly higher levels of <e48>@chemical$ CRP @/chemical$</e48> and <e49>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e49>, lower levels of <e50>@chemical$ oxytocin @/chemical$</e50>, <e51>@chemical$ iron @/chemical$</e51>, and <e52>@chemical$ zinc @/chemical$</e52>, lower relative abundance of <i><e53>@bacteria$ Bifidobacterium @/bacteria$</e53></i> and <i><e54>@bacteria$ Parabacteroides @/bacteria$</e54></i>, and higher relative abundance of <i><e55>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e55></i>, <i><e56>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e56>,</i> and <i><e57>@bacteria$ Clostridium @/bacteria$</e57></i> when compared with <e58>@human$ controls @/human$</e58>. These results suggest that these indicators may be a potential biomarker panel for the diagnosis or determining therapeutic targets of <e59>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e59>. Furthermore, <e60>@statistical technique$ large, sample-based, and randomized controlled trials @/statistical technique$</e60> are needed to confirm these results."

A healthy diet plays an integral role in maintaining the gut microbiota equilibrium, thus promoting digestive health. The structure and function of <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> are affected by genetics and environmental factors, such as altered dietary habits, <e8>@DDF$ gastroenteritis @/DDF$</e8>, <e9>@DDF$ stress @/DDF$</e9>, increased use of alcohol and drugs, and medication use. Whereas there are various management approaches cited in the literature to manage symptoms of <e10>@DDF$ IBS @/DDF$</e10>, the purpose of this article is to focus on dietary options that will restore the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e11> and help in managing <e12>@DDF$ IBS @/DDF$</e12> symptoms. Some of the diets that are discussed in this article include a low-FODMAP (<e13>@chemical$ fermentable oligosaccharides @/chemical$</e13>, <e14>@chemical$ disaccharides @/chemical$</e14>, <e15>@chemical$ monosaccharides @/chemical$</e15>, and <e16>@chemical$ polyols @/chemical$</e16>) diet, gluten-free/wheat-free diet, high-fiber diet, dietary and herbal supplements (<e17>@dietary supplement$ psyllium @/dietary supplement$</e17>, <e18>@dietary supplement$ peppermint oil @/dietary supplement$</e18>), and <e19>@dietary supplement$ probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics @/dietary supplement$</e19>. The clinical practice guidelines recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology outlines evidence-based dietary recommendations for <e20>@human$ patients @/human$</e20> with <e21>@DDF$ IBS @/DDF$</e21> to manage symptoms. Recent advancements in the dietary management of <e22>@DDF$ IBS @/DDF$</e22> highlighting the use of a patient-centered, personalized nutrition approach along with lifestyle changes, pharmacological therapies, and psychosocial and behavioral interventions are also reviewed and discussed."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e3>@DDF$ Bipolar disorder @/DDF$</e3> (<e4>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e4>) is a <e5>@DDF$ mood disorder @/DDF$</e5> that affects millions worldwide. Up to half of the <e6>@human$ diagnosed patients @/human$</e6> are reported to not receive adequate treatment. This study aims to assess the relationship between the gut-brain axis and <e7>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e7> and to discuss and compare the efficacy of varying methods of balancing <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiotas @/microbiome$</e8> in <e9>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e9>. Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar from November 2021 to February 2022, we found 5310 studies on <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e10> and its relation to <e11>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e11>. Using our inclusion criteria, 5283 studies were excluded. A total of 27 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Also, 12 articles that met our criteria and eligibility criteria reported on 613 <e12>@human$ BD patients @/human$</e12>. Most studies analyzed found an overall difference in gut microbiota composition in <e13>@human$ bipolar patients @/human$</e13> compared to <e14>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e14>, though the alterations found were not consistent. Differences in <e15>@bacteria$ Lactobacillus @/bacteria$</e15>, <e16>@bacteria$ Faecalibacterium @/bacteria$</e16>, and <e17>@bacteria$ Ruminococcus @/bacteria$</e17> abundance in <e18>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e18> compared to <e19>@human$ controls @/human$</e19> were found to be the most consistent across a few of the studies, but their effects on the gut-brain axis conflicted. <e20>@dietary supplement$ Probiotic supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e20> was found to lower patient rehospitalizations and significantly improve <e21>@DDF$ depressive symptoms @/DDF$</e21> and <e22>@DDF$ cognitive impairments @/DDF$</e22> among <e23>@human$ patients @/human$</e23> with <e24>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e24>. Multiple studies included in this review point toward a possible link between <e25>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e25> and the <e26>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e26>. <e27>@dietary supplement$ Probiotic supplements @/dietary supplement$</e27> and other gut-balancing therapies could serve as effective adjunctive methods for the treatment of <e28>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e28>. Notable limitations of the studies included for analysis were small sample sizes and majority observational study designs. Furthermore, the microbiota aberrations found in <e29>@human$ patients @/human$</e29> with <e30>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e30> were not consistent across multiple studies. Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the need for further research regarding the relationship between aberrant gut microbiota profiles and <e31>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e31>, as well as the effectiveness of gut balancing methods as adjunctive treatments."

To deprive <e13>@animal$ lactating offspring @/animal$</e13> of <e14>@chemical$ 6'SL @/chemical$</e14>, we cross-fostered <e15>@animal$ newborn wild-type (WT) pups @/animal$</e15> to <e16>@animal$ KO dams @/animal$</e16>, which provide <e17>@food$ 6'SL-deficient milk @/food$</e17>. To test whether lactational 6'SL deprivation affects cognitive capabilities in adulthood, we assessed attention, perseveration, and memory. To detail the associated endophenotypes, we investigated hippocampal electrophysiology, <e18>@biomedical technique$ plasma metabolomics @/biomedical technique$</e18>, and gut microbiota composition. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed gene expression (at eye-opening and in adulthood) in two brain regions mediating executive functions and memory (<e19>@anatomical location$ hippocampus @/anatomical location$</e19> and <e20>@anatomical location$ prefrontal cortex @/anatomical location$</e20>, <e21>@anatomical location$ PFC @/anatomical location$</e21>).

These were associated with a site- (PFC) and time-specific (eye-opening) reduced expression of genes involved in central nervous system development.

Alterations in the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e6> have been proposed as the earliest event in <e7>@DDF$ PD pathogenesis @/DDF$</e7>. PD symptoms often demonstrate sex differences. Glutamatergic neurotransmission has long been linked to <e8>@DDF$ PD pathology @/DDF$</e8>. <e9>@chemical$ Metabotropic glutamate receptors @/chemical$</e9> (<e10>@chemical$ mGlu @/chemical$</e10>), a family of <e11>@chemical$ G protein-coupled receptors @/chemical$</e11>, are divided into three groups, with <e12>@chemical$ group III mGlu receptors @/chemical$</e12> mainly localized presynaptically where they can inhibit glutamate release in the <e13>@anatomical location$ CNS @/anatomical location$</e13> as well as in the <e14>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e14>. Additionally, the <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e15> can communicate with the <e16>@anatomical location$ CNS @/anatomical location$</e16> via the gut-brain axis. Here, we assessed whether deficiency of <e17>@chemical$ metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 @/chemical$</e17> (<e18>@chemical$ mGlu8 @/chemical$</e18>), <e19>@chemical$ group III mGlu @/chemical$</e19>, modulates the effects of the neurotoxin, <e20>@chemical$ 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine @/chemical$</e20> (<e21>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e21>), on behavioral and cognitive performance in <e22>@animal$ female and male mice @/animal$</e22>. We studied whether these effects are associated with changes in <e23>@gene$ striatal tyrosine hydroxylase @/gene$</e23> (<e24>@gene$ TH @/gene$</e24>) levels and the <e25>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e25>. Two-week sub-chronic MPTP increased activity of <e26>@animal$ female and male wild-type (WT) and mGlu8 knockout (KO) mice @/animal$</e26> in the open field. <e27>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e27> also showed genotype- and sex-dependent effects. <e28>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e28> increased the time <e29>@animal$ WT @/animal$</e29>, but not <e30>@animal$ KO @/animal$</e30>, females and males spent exploring objects. In <e31>@animal$ WT mice @/animal$</e31>, <e32>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e32> improved sensorimotor function in <e33>@animal$ males @/animal$</e33> but impaired it in <e34>@animal$ females @/animal$</e34>. Further, <e35>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e35> impaired cued fear memory in <e36>@animal$ WT @/animal$</e36>, but not <e37>@animal$ KO @/animal$</e37>, male mice. <e38>@chemical$ MPTP @/chemical$</e38> reduced striatal TH levels in <e39>@animal$ WT and KO mice @/animal$</e39> but these effects were only pronounced in <e40>@animal$ males @/animal$</e40>. MPTP treatment and genotype affected the diversity of the <e41>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e41>. In addition, there were significant associations between microbiome \u03b1-diversity and sensorimotor performance, as well as microbiome composition and fear learning. These results indicate that specific taxa may directly affect motor and fear learning or that the same physiological effects that enhance both forms of learning also alter diversity of the <e42>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e42>. MPTP's effect on motor and cognitive performance may then be, at least in part, be mediated by the <e43>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e43>. These data also support <e44>@chemical$ mGlu8 @/chemical$</e44> as a novel therapeutic target for <e45>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e45> and highlight the importance of including both sexes in preclinical studies."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e4>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e4> (<e5>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e5>), a <e6>@DDF$ progressive neurodegenerative disorder @/DDF$</e6>, is associated with the destruction of dopamine neurons in the <e7>@anatomical location$ substantia nigra @/anatomical location$</e7> (<e8>@anatomical location$ SN @/anatomical location$</e8>) and the formation of Lewy bodies in <e9>@anatomical location$ basal ganglia @/anatomical location$</e9>. Risk factors for <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10> include aging, as well as environmental and genetic factors. Recent converging reports suggest a role for the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e11> and epigenetic factors in the onset and/or progression of <e12>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e12>. Of particular relevance and potential therapeutic targets in this regard are <e13>@chemical$ histone deacetylases @/chemical$</e13> (<e14>@chemical$ HDACs @/chemical$</e14>), enzymes that are involved in chromatin remodeling. <e15>@chemical$ Butyrate @/chemical$</e15>, a <e16>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acid @/chemical$</e16> (<e17>@chemical$ FA @/chemical$</e17>) produced in the <e18>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e18> and presumably acting via several <e19>@chemical$ G protein-coupled receptors @/chemical$</e19> (<e20>@chemical$ GPCRs @/chemical$</e20>) including <e21>@chemical$ FA3 receptors @/chemical$</e21> (<e22>@chemical$ FA3Rs @/chemical$</e22>), is a well-known <e23>@chemical$ HDAC @/chemical$</e23> inhibitor that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. Recently, its significance in regulation of some critical brain functions and usefulness in <e24>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e24> such as <e25>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e25> has been suggested. In this study we sought to determine whether <e26>@chemical$ butyrate @/chemical$</e26> may have protective effects against <e27>@DDF$ salsolionl (SALS)-induced toxicity @/DDF$</e27> in SH-SY5Y cells. <e28>@chemical$ SALS @/chemical$</e28>, an endogenous product of aldehyde and dopamine condensation, may be selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons. SH-SY5Y cells, derived from human neuroblastoma cells, are used as a model of these neurons. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells for 24\u00a0h to 400\u00a0\u03bcM <e29>@chemical$ SALS @/chemical$</e29> resulted in approximately 60% cell death, which was concentration-dependently prevented by <e30>@chemical$ butyrate @/chemical$</e30>. The effects of <e31>@chemical$ butyrate @/chemical$</e31> in turn were significantly attenuated by <e32>@drug$ beta-hydroxy butyrate @/drug$</e32> (<e33>@drug$ BHB @/drug$</e33>), a selective <e34>@chemical$ FA3R @/chemical$</e34> antagonist. Moreover, a selective <e35>@chemical$ FA3R @/chemical$</e35> agonist (<e36>@drug$ AR 420626 @/drug$</e36>) also provided protective effects against <e37>@chemical$ SALS @/chemical$</e37>, which was totally blocked by <e38>@drug$ BHB @/drug$</e38>. These findings provide further support that <e39>@chemical$ butyrate @/chemical$</e39> or an agonist of <e40>@chemical$ FA3R @/chemical$</e40> may be of therapeutic potential in <e41>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e41>."

But not to diminish such findings, much still needs to be considered, including the fact that the <e6>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e6> links to many other body sites that also host a microbiome. Questions remain that touch the core of being human: (i) Do our microbes influence happiness and to what extent? (ii) What components of the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> and their function, including as it relates to mental health, are critical and how do they differ between <e8>@human$ agile, fit hunter gatherers @/human$</e8> and <e9>@human$ obese westerners @/human$</e9> or <e10>@human$ Danes @/human$</e10> described as the <e11>@human$ happiest people @/human$</e11> on the planet? (iii) What role do <e12>@chemical$ environmental pollutants @/chemical$</e12> play in this microbes-host ecosystem? While approaching life from a reductionist perspective has a long history in science, we need to try to interrogate these health and disease issues from a wider perspective. For verification of a link between the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> and <e14>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e14>, and to test new therapies, human studies are needed, and are long overdue."

Although human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem/progenitor cells present with no or minimal capacity of differentiation into mature dopaminergic neurons, their transplantation significantly attenuates <e8>@DDF$ parkinsonian symptoms @/DDF$</e8> likely via bystander effects, specifically stem cell graft-mediated secretion of growth factors, <e9>@chemical$ anti-inflammatory cytokines @/chemical$</e9>, or synaptic function altogether promoting brain repair. Recognizing this non-cell replacement mechanism, we examined here the effects of intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB-derived plasma into the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rat model of <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10>.

Compared to vehicle treatment, transplantation with <e13>@chemical$ hUCB-derived plasma @/chemical$</e13> significantly improved motor function, gut motility and dopaminergic neuronal survival in the <e14>@anatomical location$ substantia nigra pars compacta @/anatomical location$</e14> (<e15>@anatomical location$ SNpc @/anatomical location$</e15>), which coincided with reduced <e16>@chemical$ pro-inflammatory cytokines @/chemical$</e16> in both the <e17>@anatomical location$ SNpc @/anatomical location$</e17> and the intestinal mucosa and dampened <e18>@microbiome$ inflammation-associated gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e18>. These novel data directly implicate a key pathological crosstalk between <e19>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e19> and <e20>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e20> ushering a new avenue of therapeutically targeting the <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e21> with hUCB-derived stem cells and plasma for <e22>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e22>."

Development of these alternative strategies is predicated on experimental evidence and diligent research on the biology of <e8>@DDF$ stress @/DDF$</e8>, <e9>@DDF$ fear @/DDF$</e9>, <e10>@DDF$ anxiety-related behaviors @/DDF$</e10>, and the gut-brain connection. This article provides a brief overview on biological markers of <e11>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e11> and the expanding nutritional literature relating to brain health and <e12>@DDF$ mental disorders @/DDF$</e12>. A case study demonstrates an example of a biopsychosocial approach integrating cognitive psychotherapy, dietary changes, and mindfulness activities, in treating symptoms of <e13>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e13>. This case study shows a possible treatment protocol to explore the efficacy of targeting the gut-brain-axis that may be used as an impetus for future controlled studies."

Through the last two decades of research, there has been growing consensus that inflammation-mediated oxidative stress, <e5>@DDF$ mitochondrial dysfunction @/DDF$</e5>, and cytokine-induced toxicity are mainly involved in neuronal damage and loss associated with <e6>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e6>. However, it remains unclear how these mechanisms relate to <e7>@DDF$ sporadic PD @/DDF$</e7>, a more common form of <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8>. Both enteric and central nervous systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <e9>@DDF$ sporadic PD @/DDF$</e9>, thus highlighting the crosstalk between the <e10>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e10> and <e11>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e11>. of Review: In this review, we summarize how alterations in the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e12> can affect PD pathogenesis. We highlight various mechanisms increasing/decreasing the risk of PD development. Based on the previous supporting evidence, we suggest how early interventions could protect against PD development and how controlling specific factors, including our diet, could modify our perspective on disease mechanisms and therapeutics. We explain the strong relationship between the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> and the <e14>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e14> in <e15>@human$ PD subjects @/human$</e15>, by delineating the multiple mechanisms involved inneuroinflammation and oxidative stress. We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e16> and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in <e17>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e17>. In some studies, <e18>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e18> have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in <e19>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e19> via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences. However, there is a significant unmet need for randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of microbial products, <e20>@dietary supplement$ probiotic-based supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e20>, and dietary intervention in reversing <e21>@DDF$ gut microbial dysbiosis @/DDF$</e21> in <e22>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e22>."

The potential mechanisms behind <e19>@DDF$ PD-related constipation @/DDF$</e19> include dysfunction of the enteric nervous system due to alpha-synuclein aggregation, <e20>@DDF$ dyssynergic contractions @/DDF$</e20> of the <e21>@anatomical location$ puborectalis muscle @/anatomical location$</e21>, and alterations of the <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e22>. To conduct this study, we searched Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar for published articles on <e23>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e23>, <e24>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e24>, and <e25>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e25>. We selected RCTs from 944 studies, and ultimately included 3 RCTs in our <e26>@statistical technique$ meta-analysis @/statistical technique$</e26>. The frequency of bowel movements per week was the only index that could be summarized among the records. We extracted and analyzed the results as means and <e27>@statistical technique$ standard deviations @/statistical technique$</e27>. We calculated a <e28>@statistical technique$ standardized mean difference @/statistical technique$</e28> (<e29>@statistical technique$ SMD @/statistical technique$</e29>) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.19; I-squared\u00a0=\u00a057.0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) to determine the treatment effect in terms of frequency of bowel movements per week in the RCTs. Our results show that <e30>@dietary supplement$ probiotic intake @/dietary supplement$</e30> has beneficial effects on <e31>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e31> in <e32>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e32>.

Despite tremendous progress in the field, the exact pathways and mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of this disease remain unclear. However, recent research suggests a potential relationship between the <e16>@bacteria$ commensal gut bacteria @/bacteria$</e16> and the <e17>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e17> capable of influencing neurodevelopment, brain function and health. This bidirectional communication is often referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the onset of <e18>@DDF$ non-motor symptoms @/DDF$</e18>, such as <e19>@DDF$ gastrointestinal manifestations @/DDF$</e19>, often precede the onset of <e20>@DDF$ motor symptoms @/DDF$</e20> and disease diagnosis, lending support to the potential role that the microbiome-gut-brain axis might play in the underlying pathological mechanisms of <e21>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e21>. This review will provide an overview of and critically discuss the current knowledge of the relationship between the <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e22> and <e23>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e23>. We will discuss the role of <e24>@chemical$ \u03b1-synuclein @/chemical$</e24> in non-motor disease pathology, proposed pathways constituting the connection between the <e25>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e25> and the <e26>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e26>, existing evidence related to pre- and probiotic interventions. Finally, we will highlight the potential opportunity for the development of novel preventative measures and therapeutic options that could target the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the context of <e27>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e27>."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of a single faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in <e6>@human$ patients @/human$</e6> with <e7>@DDF$ early-stage PD @/DDF$</e7>. The GUT-PARFECT trial, a single-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Ghent University Hospital between December 01, 2020 and December 12, 2022. <e8>@human$ Participants @/human$</e8> (aged 50-65 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) were randomly assigned to receive nasojejunal FMT with either healthy donor stool or their own stool. <e9>@statistical technique$ Computer-generated randomisation @/statistical technique$</e9> was done in a 1:1 ratio through <e10>@statistical technique$ permutated-block scheduling @/statistical technique$</e10>. Treatment allocation was concealed for <e11>@human$ participants @/human$</e11> and investigators. The primary outcome measure at 12 months was the change in the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score obtained during off-medication evaluations. <e12>@statistical technique$ Intention-to-treat analysis @/statistical technique$</e12> was performed using a <e13>@statistical technique$ mixed model for repeated measures analysis @/statistical technique$</e13>. This completed trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03808389). Between December 2020 and December 2021, FMT procedures were conducted on 46 <e14>@human$ patients @/human$</e14> with <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15>: 22 in the <e16>@human$ healthy donor group @/human$</e16> and 24 in the <e17>@human$ placebo group @/human$</e17>. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-FMT. Full data analysis was possible for 21 <e18>@human$ participants @/human$</e18> in the <e19>@human$ healthy donor group @/human$</e19> and 22 in the <e20>@human$ placebo group @/human$</e20>. After 12 months, the MDS-UPDRS motor score significantly improved by a mean of 5.8 points (95% CI\u00a0-11.4 to\u00a0-0.2) in the <e21>@human$ healthy donor group @/human$</e21> and by 2.7 points (-8.3 to 2.9) in the <e22>@human$ placebo group @/human$</e22> (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0235). Adverse events were limited to temporary <e23>@DDF$ abdominal discomfort @/DDF$</e23>. Our findings suggested a single FMT induced mild, but long-lasting beneficial effects on <e24>@DDF$ motor symptoms @/DDF$</e24> in <e25>@human$ patients @/human$</e25> with <e26>@DDF$ early-stage PD @/DDF$</e26>. These findings highlight the potential of modulating the <e27>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e27> as a therapeutic approach and warrant a further exploration of FMT in larger cohorts of <e28>@human$ patients @/human$</e28> with <e29>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e29> in various disease stages.

Yet, the verdict is still out on the definitive role of <i><e6>@bacteria$ P. copri @/bacteria$</e6></i> in human health, and on the effect of different diets on its relative abundance in the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e7>. The puzzling discrepancies among <i><e8>@bacteria$ P. copri @/bacteria$</e8></i> studies have only recently been attributed to the diversity of its strains, which substantially differ in their encoded metabolic patterns from the commonly used reference strain. However, such strain differences cannot be resolved by common <e9>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA amplicon profiling methods @/biomedical technique$</e9>. Here, we scrutinize <i><e10>@bacteria$ P. copri @/bacteria$</e10></i>, its versatile metabolic potential, and the hypotheses behind the conflicting observations on its association with diet and human health. We also provide suggestions for designing studies and bioinformatics pipelines to better research <i><e11>@bacteria$ P. copri @/bacteria$</e11></i>."

This study investigated fecal microbial features associated with mental health outcomes (symptoms of <e7>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e7>, <e8>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e8>, or <e9>@DDF$ posttraumatic stress disorder @/DDF$</e9> (<e10>@DDF$ PTSD @/DDF$</e10>)) in a <e11>@human$ Spanish cohort @/human$</e11> in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Microbial communities from stool samples were profiled in 198 <e12>@human$ individuals @/human$</e12> who completed validated, self-report questionnaires. <e13>@biomedical technique$ 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3-4 amplicon sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13> was performed. Microbial diversity and community structure were analyzed, together with relative taxonomic abundance. In our cohort of N=198, 17.17% reported depressive symptoms, 37.37% state anxiety symptoms, 40.90% trait anxiety symptoms, and 8.08% PTSD symptoms, with high levels of comorbidity. <e14>@human$ Individuals @/human$</e14> with <e15>@DDF$ trait anxiety @/DDF$</e15> had lower Simpson's diversity. <i><e16>@bacteria$ Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans @/bacteria$</e16></i> was reduced in <e17>@human$ individuals @/human$</e17> with comorbid PTSD + depression + state and trait anxiety symptoms, whilst an expansion of <e18>@bacteria$ Proteobacteria @/bacteria$</e18> and depletion of <e19>@bacteria$ Synergistetes phyla @/bacteria$</e19> were noted in <e20>@human$ individuals @/human$</e20> with depressive symptoms. The relative abundance of <i><e21>@bacteria$ Anaerostipes @/bacteria$</e21></i> was positively correlated with childhood trauma, and higher levels of <i><e22>@bacteria$ Turicibacter sanguinis @/bacteria$</e22></i> and lower levels of <e23>@bacteria$ Lentisphaerae @/bacteria$</e23> were found in <e24>@human$ individuals @/human$</e24> who experienced life-threatening traumas. <e25>@DDF$ COVID-19 infection @/DDF$</e25> and vaccination influenced the overall microbial composition and were associated with distinct relative taxonomic abundance profiles. These findings will help lay the foundation for future studies to identify microbial role players in symptoms of <e26>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e26>, <e27>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e27>, and <e28>@DDF$ PTSD @/DDF$</e28> and provide future therapeutic targets to improve mental health outcomes."

This has led to the strategy of targeting the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> to ameliorate <e5>@DDF$ disorders of the central nervous system @/DDF$</e5>. Understanding the underlying signalling pathways in which the microbiota impacts these disorders is crucial for the development of future therapeutics for improving CNS functionality. One of the major pathways through which the microbiota influences the <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> is the immune system, where there is an increasing appreciation for the role of monocyte trafficking in regulating brain homeostasis. In this review, we will shed light on the role of monocyte trafficking as a relay of microbiota signals in conditions where the central nervous system is in disorder, such as <e7>@DDF$ stress @/DDF$</e7>, <e8>@DDF$ peripheral inflammation @/DDF$</e8>, ageing, <e9>@DDF$ traumatic brain injury @/DDF$</e9>, <e10>@DDF$ stroke @/DDF$</e10>, <e11>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e11>, <e12>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e12> and <e13>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e13>. We also cover how the <e14>@microbiome$ gastrointestinal microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> is implicated in these <e15>@DDF$ mental illnesses @/DDF$</e15>. In addition, we aim to discuss how the monocyte system can be modulated by the <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e16> to mitigate disorders of the central nervous system, which will lead to novel microbiota-targeted strategies."

      "abstract_tagged": "There is now a large volume of evidence to support the view that the immune system is a key communication pathway between the <e1>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e1> and <e2>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e2>, which plays an important role in <e3>@DDF$ stress-related psychopathologies @/DDF$</e3> and thus provides a potentially fruitful target for psychotropic intervention. The <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of organisms and a sophisticated genomic structure. Bacteria within the <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> are estimated to weigh in excess of 1\u2009kg in the <e6>@human$ adult human @/human$</e6> and the microbes within not only produce <e7>@chemical$ antimicrobial peptides @/chemical$</e7>, <e8>@chemical$ short chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e8>, and <e9>@chemical$ vitamins @/chemical$</e9>, but also most of the common neurotransmitters found in the <e10>@anatomical location$ human brain @/anatomical location$</e10>. That the microbial content of the <e11>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e11> plays a key role in immune development is now beyond doubt. Early disruption of the host-microbe interplay can have lifelong consequences, not just in terms of intestinal function but in distal organs including the <e12>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e12>. It is clear that the immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication in order to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain about the effect of the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. However, studies using <e14>@animal$ germ-free animals @/animal$</e14>, infective models, <e15>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e15>, <e16>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e16>, and <e17>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e17> have increased our understanding of the interplay. <e18>@DDF$ Early life stress @/DDF$</e18> can have a lifelong impact on the microbial content of the <e19>@anatomical location$ intestine @/anatomical location$</e19> and permanently alter immune functioning. That <e20>@DDF$ early life stress @/DDF$</e20> can also impact <e21>@DDF$ adult psychopathology @/DDF$</e21> has long been appreciated in psychiatry. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e22>, immune, and central nervous systems in a network of communication that impacts behavior patterns and psychopathology, to eventually translate these findings to the human situation both in health and disease. Even at this juncture, there is evidence to pinpoint key sites of communication where gut microbial interventions either with drugs or diet or perhaps fecal microbiota transplantation may positively impact mental health."

In this study, we recruited more than 300 biopsy specimens from <e12>@human$ people @/human$</e12> undergoing <e13>@biomedical technique$ colonoscopy @/biomedical technique$</e13>, and we analyzed to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence of <e14>@gene$ bacterial genes @/gene$</e14> coding for <e15>@chemical$ toxins @/chemical$</e15> possibly involved in <e16>@DDF$ CRC onset and progression @/DDF$</e16> and the different stages of <e17>@DDF$ CRC @/DDF$</e17>.

Interactions between the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> and <e8>@DDF$ ocular conditions @/DDF$</e8> have been identified in <e9>@DDF$ pSS @/DDF$</e9>. As mental intervention is frequently needed, this study aims to investigate the relationship between <e10>@DDF$ anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e10> and the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e11> in <e12>@human$ patients @/human$</e12> with <e13>@DDF$ pSS-mediated dry eye @/DDF$</e13>. Demographics and self-administered questionnaires were obtained. Faecal samples were evaluated using <e14>@biomedical technique$ 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e14>. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) cut-off point of \u2265 8 points showed a sensitivity and specificity of 76.5% and 80.0%, respectively. In all <e15>@human$ participants @/human$</e15>, we found that the prevalence of <e16>@DDF$ anxiety disorder @/DDF$</e16> was 30.4%. <e17>@DDF$ Dry eye discomfort @/DDF$</e17> could promote an anxious state, and conversely, <e18>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e18> could threaten tear film and increase the risk of pSS activity. There was a certain correlation between <e19>@DDF$ anxiety disorder @/DDF$</e19> and <e20>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e20>. <e21>@bacteria$ Prevotella @/bacteria$</e21> was associated with dry eye severity (<i>p</i> <0.001). <e22>@bacteria$ Bacteroidetes @/bacteria$</e22> (<i>p</i> =0.046) and <e23>@bacteria$ Odoribacter @/bacteria$</e23> (<i>p</i> =0.001) were correlated with pSS activity. There is a bidirectional relationship between <e24>@DDF$ anxiety disorder @/DDF$</e24> and the <e25>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e25> in pSS-mediated dry eye. Alterations in certain classes of <e26>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e26> are associated with pSS activity and dry eye severity. <e27>@DDF$ Main gut microbiota alterations @/DDF$</e27> that have a facilitating impact on <e28>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e28> are emerging in <e29>@DDF$ pSS-mediated dry eye @/DDF$</e29>. Future studies are needed to explore specific therapeutic targets for improving mental health in <e30>@DDF$ pSS-mediated dry eye @/DDF$</e30> by microbiota intervention."

Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. <b>Results:</b> Although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with <e45>@DDF$ IBD @/DDF$</e45>, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with <e46>@DDF$ IBD disease activity @/DDF$</e46>. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and <e47>@DDF$ IBD disease activity @/DDF$</e47>. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the <e48>@DDF$ pathophysiology of IBD @/DDF$</e48>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Longitudinal monitoring of <e49>@human$ IBD patients @/human$</e49> and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in <e50>@DDF$ IBD @/DDF$</e50>. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life."

Treatment with an <e13>@drug$ antibiotic cocktail @/drug$</e13> for 14 days significantly decreased the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the <e14>@anatomical location$ host gut @/anatomical location$</e14>. <e15>@bacteria$ Proteobacteria @/bacteria$</e15> were markedly increased after treatment with the <e16>@drug$ antibiotic cocktail @/drug$</e16>.

These are typically energy-dense, nutrient-poor and contribute to the rising prevalence of <e4>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e4> and <e5>@DDF$ chronic disease burden @/DDF$</e5>. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether a community-based cooking program instigated a change to participants' skills, attitudes, knowledge, enjoyment and satisfaction of cooking and cooking confidence (self-efficacy). The pseudo-random, pre-post study design consisted of an intervention and a control group. Participant recruitment and group allocation was based on their program start dates. Intervention participants were surveyed three times (baseline, 7\u2009weeks and 6\u2009months) and the control group were surveyed at baseline and 5\u2009weeks. All <e6>@human$ participants @/human$</e6> were registered via an online website and were 18\u2009years or over. Upon consent, <e7>@human$ participants @/human$</e7> were offered four levels of commitment, defined by different assessments. The minimum participation level included an online survey and levels 2, 3 and 4 involved attendance at a clinic with increasing functional, anthropometric and biomarker measurements. Primary endpoints were participants' cooking confidence as a proxy for self-efficacy. Secondary endpoints were dietary intake, physical activity levels, body composition, anthropometry, blood, urine and faecal biomarkers of systemic, physical and mental health. The community cooking program provided <e8>@human$ participants @/human$</e8> with information and advice on food sourcing, preparation and nutrition to improve home cooking skills. The study was designed to explore whether food literacy programs are efficacious in improving participant physical health and well-being in order to combat the rise in <e9>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ diet-related disease @/DDF$</e10>. It will support future use of public health cooking program initiatives aimed at improving food literacy, self-efficacy and physical and mental health. The extensive data collected will inform future research into the relationship between diet, the <e11>@microbiome$ gut-microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> and human health.

These symptoms not only impact patient quality of life, but also complicate disease management. Conventional treatment pathways for <e14>@DDF$ GI dysfunctions @/DDF$</e14> (i.e., <e15>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e15>), such as increasing fibre and fluid intake, and the use of <e16>@drug$ over-the-counter laxatives @/drug$</e16>, are generally ineffective in <e17>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e17>, and approved compounds such as <e18>@drug$ guanylate cyclase C agonists @/drug$</e18> and <e19>@drug$ selective 5-hyroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonists @/drug$</e19> have demonstrated limited efficacy. Thus, identification of potential targets for novel therapies to alleviate <e20>@DDF$ PD-induced GI dysfunctions @/DDF$</e20> are essential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in <e21>@human$ people @/human$</e21> with <e22>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e22>. Unlike the central nervous system (CNS), where <e23>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e23> pathology and the mechanisms involved in <e24>@DDF$ CNS damage @/DDF$</e24> are relatively well characterised, the effect of <e25>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e25> at the cellular and tissue level in the <e26>@anatomical location$ enteric nervous system @/anatomical location$</e26> (<e27>@anatomical location$ ENS @/anatomical location$</e27>) remains unclear, making it difficult to alleviate or reverse <e28>@DDF$ GI symptoms @/DDF$</e28>. However, the resurgence of interest in understanding how the <e29>@anatomical location$ GI tract @/anatomical location$</e29> is involved in various disease states, such as <e30>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e30>, has resulted in the identification of novel therapeutic avenues. This review focuses on common <e31>@DDF$ PD-related GI symptoms @/DDF$</e31>, and summarizes the current treatments available and their limitations. We propose that by targeting the <e32>@anatomical location$ intestinal barrier @/anatomical location$</e32>, <e33>@anatomical location$ ENS @/anatomical location$</e33>, and/or the <e34>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e34>, may prove successful in alleviating <e35>@DDF$ PD-related GI symptoms @/DDF$</e35>, and discuss emerging therapies and potential drugs that could be repurposed to target these areas."

However, recent studies in <e9>@animal$ specific pathogen-free (SPF) rodents @/animal$</e9> suggest a different--and potentially contradictory--relationship between immune processes and mental health. These studies suggest that effector T cells specific for <e10>@chemical$ central nervous system (CNS) antigens @/chemical$</e10> can assist recovery from an array of environmental insults ranging from <e11>@DDF$ nerve injury @/DDF$</e11> to <e12>@DDF$ psychological stress @/DDF$</e12>, while in contrast, regulatory T cells (Treg) oppose such recovery.

These findings pose a dilemma for those intending to manipulate inflammatory pathways as a treatment for <e14>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e14>. Should we administer anti-inflammatory treatments, or should we induce self-reactive T cells? We re-examine the rodent findings and outline immunological peculiarities of <e15>@animal$ SPF rodents @/animal$</e15>, the abnormal properties of their regulatory T cells, and the impact of <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e16>. We find that \"protective autoimmunity\" is likely to be relevant only to very clean <e17>@animal$ SPF animals @/animal$</e17> that lack normal levels of activated T cells, CNS T cell traffic and mature Treg. The data indicate that even in SPF models the effectors of beneficial effects are not the proinflammatory autoimmune cells themselves, but rather unidentified regulatory cells. This reinterpretation of findings relevant to \"protective autoimmunity\" suggests that ongoing, and planned, clinical trials of anti-inflammatory strategies to treat <e18>@DDF$ depressive disorders @/DDF$</e18> are justified."

Stool samples from these individuals were first analysed by <e14>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e14>.\u00a0Second, we predicted the potential secretion for 129 <e15>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e15> through personalised <e16>@biomedical technique$ metabolic modelling @/biomedical technique$</e16> using the microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of <e17>@bacteria$ human gut microbes @/bacteria$</e17>.

Eight genera and seven species changed significantly in their relative abundances between <e18>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e18> and <e19>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e19>. PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and <e20>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e20>. Particularly,\u00a0the relative abundances of <e21>@bacteria$ Bilophila @/bacteria$</e21> and <e22>@bacteria$ Paraprevotella @/bacteria$</e22> were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging after controlling for the disease duration. Furthermore, personalised metabolic modelling of the <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiomes @/microbiome$</e23> revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in the predicted secretion potential of nine <e24>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e24> in <e25>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e25>, including increased <e26>@chemical$ methionine @/chemical$</e26> and <e27>@chemical$ cysteinylglycine @/chemical$</e27>. The predicted microbial pantothenic acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific <e28>@DDF$ non-motor symptoms @/DDF$</e28>. Our results suggest that <e29>@DDF$ PD-associated alterations @/DDF$</e29> of the <e30>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e30> can translate into substantial functional differences affecting host metabolism and disease phenotype."

The disease and its treatments exert profound effects on an individual's physical and mental health. There are many factors that impact an individual's risk of developing <e5>@DDF$ breast cancer @/DDF$</e5>, their response to treatments, and their risk of recurrence. The community of microorganisms inhabiting the <e6>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e6>, the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7>, affects human health through metabolic, neural, and endocrine signaling, and immune activity. It is through these mechanisms that the <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> appears to influence breast cancer risk, response to treatment, and recurrence. A disrupted <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9> or state of '<e10>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e10>' can contribute to a biological environment associated with higher risk for cancer development as well as contribute to negative treatment side-effects. Many cancer treatments have been shown to shift the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> toward <e12>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e12>; however, the microbiota can also be positively manipulated through diet, <e13>@dietary supplement$ prebiotic @/dietary supplement$</e13> and <e14>@dietary supplement$ probiotic supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e14>, and exercise. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e15> and <e16>@DDF$ breast cancer @/DDF$</e16> and to highlight potential strategies for modulation of the <e17>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e17> that could lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall health in this population."

Following re-colonization, <e12>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e12> were subjected to comprehensive <e13>@biomedical technique$ behavioral and biochemical analyses @/biomedical technique$</e13>. The <e14>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e14> given <e15>@microbiome$ HFD microbiota @/microbiome$</e15> had significant and selective disruptions in <e16>@DDF$ exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical behavior @/DDF$</e16> compared with <e17>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e17> with <e18>@microbiome$ control diet microbiota @/microbiome$</e18> in the absence of significant differences in body weight. <e19>@biomedical technique$ Sequencing-based phylogenetic analysis @/biomedical technique$</e19> confirmed the presence of distinct <e20>@microbiome$ core microbiota @/microbiome$</e20> between groups, with alterations in \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity, modulation in taxonomic distribution, and statistically significant alterations to metabolically active taxa. <e21>@microbiome$ HFD microbiota @/microbiome$</e21> also disrupted markers of intestinal barrier function, increased <e22>@chemical$ circulating endotoxin @/chemical$</e22>, and increased lymphocyte expression of <e23>@gene$ ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 @/gene$</e23>, <e24>@gene$ toll-like receptor 2 @/gene$</e24>, and <e25>@gene$ toll-like receptor 4 @/gene$</e25>.

The spread of <e10>@DDF$ \u03b1-syn pathology @/DDF$</e10> across <e11>@anatomical location$ brain regions @/anatomical location$</e11> is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate \u03b1-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating <e12>@chemical$ polyphenolic acids @/chemical$</e12>, namely, <e13>@chemical$ 3-hydroxybenzoic acid @/chemical$</e13> (<e14>@chemical$ 3-HBA @/chemical$</e14>), <e15>@chemical$ 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid @/chemical$</e15> (<e16>@chemical$ 3,4-diHBA @/chemical$</e16>), and <e17>@chemical$ 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid @/chemical$</e17> (<e18>@chemical$ 3-HPPA @/chemical$</e18>) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of <e19>@chemical$ dietary polyphenols @/chemical$</e19>, show <i>in vitro</i> ability to effectively modulate <e20>@DDF$ \u03b1-syn misfolding @/DDF$</e20>, <e21>@DDF$ oligomerization @/DDF$</e21>, and mediate <e22>@DDF$ aggregated \u03b1-syn neurotoxicity @/DDF$</e22>. Here we investigate whether <e23>@chemical$ 3-HBA @/chemical$</e23>, <e24>@chemical$ 4-hydroxybenzoic acid @/chemical$</e24> (<e25>@chemical$ 4-HBA @/chemical$</e25>), <e26>@chemical$ 3,4-diHBA @/chemical$</e26>, or <e27>@chemical$ 3-HPPA @/chemical$</e27> interfere with \u03b1-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using <e28>@bacteria$ HEK293 cells @/bacteria$</e28> overexpressing <e29>@gene$ \u03b1-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP @/gene$</e29>, we assessed \u03b1-syn seeding activity using <e30>@biomedical technique$ Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer @/biomedical technique$</e30> (<e31>@biomedical technique$ FRET @/biomedical technique$</e31>) to detect and quantify \u03b1-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that <e32>@chemical$ 3-HPPA @/chemical$</e32>, <e33>@chemical$ 3,4-diHBA @/chemical$</e33>, <e34>@chemical$ 3-HBA @/chemical$</e34>, and <e35>@chemical$ 4-HBA @/chemical$</e35> significantly attenuated <e36>@DDF$ intracellular \u03b1-syn seeding aggregation @/DDF$</e36>. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized <e37>@chemical$ insoluble \u03b1-syn @/chemical$</e37> extracted from post-mortem <e38>@DDF$ MSA @/DDF$</e38> or <e39>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e39> brain specimens. We found that <e40>@chemical$ 3-HPPA @/chemical$</e40> effectively attenuated <e41>@DDF$ MSA-induced aggregation of monomer @/DDF$</e41> into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between <e42>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e42> and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic \u03b1-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of <e43>@dietary supplement$ probiotic @/dietary supplement$</e43>, <e44>@dietary supplement$ prebiotic @/dietary supplement$</e44>, or <e45>@dietary supplement$ synbiotic @/dietary supplement$</e45> approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of <e46>@DDF$ \u03b1-synucleinopathies @/DDF$</e46>."

In this study, we investigated whether repeated administration of <e15>@chemical$ CNO @/chemical$</e15> or <e16>@chemical$ C21 @/chemical$</e16> could influence the <e17>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e17> and <e18>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e18> (<e19>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e19>) in feces of <e20>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e20>. Repeated administration of <e21>@chemical$ CNO @/chemical$</e21> or <e22>@chemical$ C21 @/chemical$</e22> as drinking water did not alter the \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity of <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23> in <e24>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e24> compared with <e25>@animal$ control mice @/animal$</e25>. However, we found significant changes in relative abundance for several bacteria in the CNO (or C21) group at the taxonomic level compared to the control group. The <e26>@statistical technique$ linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm @/statistical technique$</e26> distinguished the family <e27>@bacteria$ Prevotellaceae @/bacteria$</e27>, the <e28>@bacteria$ genus Anaerocolumna @/bacteria$</e28>, the <e29>@bacteria$ genus Prevotella @/bacteria$</e29>, and the <e30>@bacteria$ genus Frisingicoccus @/bacteria$</e30>, these four specific microbial markers for the CNO group relative to the control group. In addition, the <e31>@statistical technique$ LEfSe @/statistical technique$</e31> algorithm identified the family <e32>@bacteria$ Clostridiaceae @/bacteria$</e32>, the <e33>@bacteria$ genus Faecalicatena @/bacteria$</e33> and the <e34>@bacteria$ genus Marinisporobacter @/bacteria$</e34>, these three bacteria of different taxonomic as potential microbial markers for the C21 group relative to the control group. In contrast, repeated administration of <e35>@chemical$ CNO @/chemical$</e35> (or <e36>@chemical$ C21 @/chemical$</e36>) did not alter <e37>@chemical$ SCFAs @/chemical$</e37> in feces samples of <e38>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e38>. The data suggest that repeated administration of <e39>@chemical$ CNO @/chemical$</e39> or <e40>@chemical$ C21 @/chemical$</e40> contributes to an unusual organization of the <e41>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e41> in <e42>@animal$ adult mice @/animal$</e42>. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of <e43>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e43> by repeated dosing of <e44>@drug$ DREADD ligands @/drug$</e44> should be taken into consideration for behavioral and biological functions in <e45>@animal$ rodents @/animal$</e45> treated with <e46>@drug$ DREADD ligands @/drug$</e46>."

Recent data from rodent and human studies indicated that <e6>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e6> causes <e7>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e7>. Remodeling <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> could be beneficial for the recovery of intestinal function and motor function after <e9>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e9>. However, few studies have explored <e10>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e10> with focus on the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> and \"microbiota-gut-brain\"\u00a0axis. In this review, the complications following <e12>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e12>, including <e13>@DDF$ intestinal dysfunction @/DDF$</e13>, <e14>@DDF$ anxiety and depression @/DDF$</e14>, <e15>@DDF$ metabolic disorders @/DDF$</e15>, and <e16>@DDF$ neuropathic pain @/DDF$</e16>, are directly or indirectly related to <e17>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e17>, which may be mediated by \"gut-brain\" interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the research strategies that can be beneficial in this regard, including <e18>@animal$ germ-free animals @/animal$</e18>, fecal microbiota transplantation, <e19>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e19>, <e20>@chemical$ phages @/chemical$</e20>, and <e21>@biomedical technique$ brain imaging techniques @/biomedical technique$</e21>. The current microbial research has shifted from descriptive to mechanismal perspective, and future research using new technologies may further demonstrate the pathophysiological mechanism of association of <e22>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e22> with <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23>, elucidate the mode of interaction of <e24>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e24> and hosts, and help develop personalized microbiota-targeted therapies and drugs based on microbiota or corresponding metabolites."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e3>@dietary supplement$ Prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e3> contribute to the well-being of their host by altering the composition of the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4>. Discovering new <e5>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e5> is a challenging and arduous task due to strict inclusion criteria; thus, highly limited numbers of prebiotic candidates have been identified. Notably, the large numbers of published studies may contain substantial information attached to various features of known <e6>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e6> that can be used to predict new candidates. In this paper, we propose a <e7>@statistical technique$ medical subject headings (MeSH)-based text mining method @/statistical technique$</e7> for identifying new <e8>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e8> with structured texts obtained from PubMed. We defined an optimal feature set for prebiotics prediction using a <e9>@statistical technique$ systematic feature-ranking algorithm @/statistical technique$</e9> with which a variety of <e10>@chemical$ carbohydrates @/chemical$</e10> can be accurately classified into different clusters in accordance with their chemical and biological attributes. The optimal feature set was used to separate positive <e11>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e11> from other <e12>@chemical$ carbohydrates @/chemical$</e12>, and a <e13>@statistical technique$ cross-validation procedure @/statistical technique$</e13> was employed to assess the prediction accuracy of the model. Our method achieved a specificity of 0.876 and a sensitivity of 0.838. Finally, we identified a high-confidence list of candidates of <e14>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e14> that are strongly supported by the literature. Our study demonstrates that <e15>@statistical technique$ text mining from high-volume biomedical literature @/statistical technique$</e15> is a promising approach in searching for new <e16>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e16>."

Break-down of this delicate balance under sustained exposure to stressors (e.g. unhealthy diets) can, however, contribute to the onset of disease. Diet is a key modifiable environmental factor that modulates the <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e3> and its metabolic capacities that, in turn, could impact human physiology. On this basis, the diet and the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> could act as synergistic forces that provide resilience against disease or that speed the progress from health to disease states. Associations between unhealthy dietary patterns, <e5>@DDF$ non-communicable diseases @/DDF$</e5> and <e6>@DDF$ intestinal dysbiosis @/DDF$</e6> can be explained by this hypothesis. Translational studies showing that <e7>@DDF$ dietary-induced alterations @/DDF$</e7> in microbial communities recapitulate some of the pathological features of the original host further support this notion. In this introductory paper by the European project MyNewGut, we briefly summarize the investigations conducted to better understand the role of dietary patterns and food components in metabolic and mental health and the specificities of the microbiome-mediating mechanisms. We also discuss how advances in the understanding of the microbiome's role in dietary health effects can help to provide acceptable scientific grounds on which to base dietary advice for promoting healthy living."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e4>@DDF$ Insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e4> stands out as one of the prevalent <e5>@DDF$ clinical sleep and psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e5>. Prior research has unequivocally demonstrated variations in the diversity and abundance of <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> among <e7>@human$ individuals @/human$</e7> with <e8>@DDF$ insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e8>. These alterations may play a direct or indirect role in the onset and progression of <e9>@DDF$ insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e9> by compromising the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study aims to evaluate the impairment of the <e10>@anatomical location$ intestinal barrier @/anatomical location$</e10> in <e11>@human$ individuals @/human$</e11> with <e12>@DDF$ insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e12> by scrutinizing the serum functionality of this barrier. 45 <e13>@human$ patients @/human$</e13> with <e14>@DDF$ chronic insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e14> and 30 matched <e15>@human$ healthy volunteers @/human$</e15> were meticulously selected based on inclusion criteria. <e16>@biomedical technique$ ELISA technology @/biomedical technique$</e16> was employed to measure serum levels of <e17>@chemical$ diamine oxidase @/chemical$</e17> (<e18>@chemical$ DAO @/chemical$</e18>), <e19>@chemical$ D-lactic acid @/chemical$</e19> (<e20>@chemical$ D-LA @/chemical$</e20>), <e21>@chemical$ intestinal fatty acid binding protein @/chemical$</e21> (<e22>@chemical$ I-FABP @/chemical$</e22>), and <e23>@chemical$ endothelin @/chemical$</e23> (<e24>@chemical$ ET @/chemical$</e24>). <e25>@statistical technique$ Spearman correlation analysis @/statistical technique$</e25> was used to explore the relationship between intestinal mucosal markers and clinical characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0. Compared to the <e26>@human$ healthy control group @/human$</e26>, the <e27>@human$ insomnia disorder group @/human$</e27> exhibited significantly elevated scores on subjective mood and sleep scales (GAD-7, PHQ-9, HAMA, HAMD, PSQI, and ISI) (P < 0.05). Overnight PSG indicated a notable increase in bed time, total wake time, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in <e28>@human$ individuals @/human$</e28> with <e29>@DDF$ insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e29>. Additionally, there was a decrease in sleep efficiency and alterations in sleep structure (increased proportion of N1 and N3 stages, prolonged N1 stage) (P < 0.05). The <e30>@human$ chronic insomnia disorder group @/human$</e30> displayed significantly reduced concentrations of <e31>@chemical$ serum DAO @/chemical$</e31>, <e32>@chemical$ D-LA @/chemical$</e32>, <e33>@chemical$ I-FABP @/chemical$</e33>, and <e34>@chemical$ ET @/chemical$</e34> (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant positive correlations were identified between intestinal epithelial barrier markers and sleep efficiency, while negative correlations were found with wake after sleep onset, total wake time, PSQI, HAMA, and HAMD. Additionally, D-LA levels were significantly positively correlated with ET concentrations. <e35>@human$ Individuals @/human$</e35> with <e36>@DDF$ chronic insomnia disorder @/DDF$</e36> manifest disruptions in sleep structure, heightened susceptibility to <e37>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e37> and depressive moods, and <e38>@DDF$ impaired intestinal barrier function @/DDF$</e38>. These findings suggest that the occurrence and development of insomnia disorder may be linked to the impairment of the intestinal barrier."

      "abstract_tagged": "Bidirectional signalling between the <e4>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e4> and the <e5>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e5> is regulated at neural, hormonal, and immunological levels. Recent studies have shown that <e6>@DDF$ helminth infections @/DDF$</e6> can alter the normal <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7>. Studies have also shown that the <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> is instrumental in the normal development, maturation and function of the <e9>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e9>. The pathophysiological pathways by which <e10>@DDF$ helminth infections @/DDF$</e10> contribute to altered cognitive function remain poorly understood. We put forward the hypothesis that <e11>@DDF$ gastrointestinal infections @/DDF$</e11> with <e12>@animal$ parasitic worms @/animal$</e12>, such as <e13>@animal$ helminths @/animal$</e13>, induce an imbalance of the gut-brain axis, which, in turn, can detrimentally manifest in brain development. Factors supporting this hypothesis are: 1) research focusing on intelligence and school performance in <e14>@human$ school-aged children @/human$</e14> has shown <e15>@DDF$ helminth infections @/DDF$</e15> to be associated with <e16>@DDF$ cognitive impairment @/DDF$</e16>, 2) disturbances in <e17>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e17> have been shown to be associated with important cognitive developmental effects, and 3) <e18>@DDF$ helminth infections @/DDF$</e18> have been shown to alter the gut microbiota structure. Evidence on the complex interactions between extrinsic (parasite) and intrinsic (host-derived) factors has been synthesised and discussed. While evidence in favour of the helminth-gut microbiota-central nervous system hypothesis is circumstantial, it would be unwise to rule it out as a possible mechanism by which <e19>@DDF$ gastrointestinal helminth infections @/DDF$</e19> induce <e20>@DDF$ childhood cognitive morbidity @/DDF$</e20>. Further empirical studies are necessary to test an indirect effect of <e21>@DDF$ helminth infections @/DDF$</e21> on the modulation of mood and behaviour through its effects on the <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e22>."

Although numerous measures have been developed to assess social cognition, only a limited number of them have become available in Japan. We are therefore planning this evaluation study for social cognition measures in Japan (ESCoM) to confirm their psychometric characteristics and to promote research focused on social cognition. Participants in the cross-sectional observational study will be 140 <e3>@human$ patients @/human$</e3> with <e4>@DDF$ schizophrenia @/DDF$</e4> recruited from three Japanese facilities and 70 <e5>@human$ healthy individuals @/human$</e5>. In our primary analysis, we will calculate several psychometric indicators with a focus on whether they can independently predict social functioning. In secondary analyses, we will assess the reliability and validity of the Japanese translations of each measure and conduct an exploratory investigation of patient background, psychiatric symptoms, defeatist performance belief, and <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> as determinants of social cognition. The protocol for this study is registered in UMIN-CTR, unique ID UMIN000043777."

Currently, <e3>@statistical technique$ statistical testing methods @/statistical technique$</e3> are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype. The limitations of <e4>@statistical technique$ statistical testing methods @/statistical technique$</e4> include that the validity of p-values/q-values depend sensitively on the correctness of models and that the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Predictive analysis using methods such as <e5>@statistical technique$ LASSO @/statistical technique$</e5> is an alternative approach for identifying associated OTUs and for measuring the predictability of the phenotype variable with OTUs and other covariate variables. We investigate three strategies of performing predictive analysis: (1) <e6>@statistical technique$ LASSO @/statistical technique$</e6>: fitting a <e7>@statistical technique$ LASSO multinomial logistic regression model @/statistical technique$</e7> to all OTU counts with specific transformation; (2) <e8>@statistical technique$ screening+GLM @/statistical technique$</e8>: screening OTUs with q-values returned by fitting a <e9>@statistical technique$ GLMM @/statistical technique$</e9> to each OTU, then fitting a <e10>@statistical technique$ GLM model @/statistical technique$</e10> using a subset of selected OTUs; (3) screening+<e11>@statistical technique$ LASSO @/statistical technique$</e11>: fitting a <e12>@statistical technique$ LASSO @/statistical technique$</e12> to a subset of OTUs selected with <e13>@statistical technique$ GLMM @/statistical technique$</e13>.

Our simulation studies show that the predictive performance of <e16>@statistical technique$ LASSO @/statistical technique$</e16> with appropriate variable transformation works remarkably well on zero-inflated data. Our results of real data analysis show that <e17>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e17> can be predicted based on selected OTUs after the binary transformation, age, and sex with high accuracy (Error Rate = 0.199, AUC = 0.872, AUPRC = 0.912).

Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the <e9>@anatomical location$ host's gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e9>. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of <e10>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e10>, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by <e11>@DDF$ aging @/DDF$</e11>. Levels of <e12>@chemical$ microbiota-derived metabolites @/chemical$</e12> are elevated in <e13>@human$ older individuals @/human$</e13> with <e14>@DDF$ age-associated diseases @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ cognitive defects @/DDF$</e15> compared to younger, <e16>@human$ healthy age groups @/human$</e16>. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include <e17>@chemical$ choline @/chemical$</e17> and <e18>@chemical$ trimethylamine @/chemical$</e18>, are known risk factors for <e19>@DDF$ age-related diseases @/DDF$</e19>. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the <e20>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e20> comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the <e21>@anatomical location$ perivascular spaces @/anatomical location$</e21>, <e22>@anatomical location$ meninges @/anatomical location$</e22>, and the <e23>@anatomical location$ choroid plexus @/anatomical location$</e23>. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and <e24>@chemical$ microbiota-derived metabolites @/chemical$</e24> and their influence on <e25>@DDF$ age-associated diseases @/DDF$</e25> caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages."

In recent years, <e6>@biomedical technique$ PBM @/biomedical technique$</e6> has been applied to the <e7>@anatomical location$ head @/anatomical location$</e7> as an investigative approach to treat diverse <e8>@DDF$ brain diseases @/DDF$</e8> such as <e9>@DDF$ stroke @/DDF$</e9>, <e10>@DDF$ traumatic brain injury @/DDF$</e10> (<e11>@DDF$ TBI @/DDF$</e11>), <e12>@DDF$ Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases @/DDF$</e12>, and <e13>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e13>. Also, in recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the total microbial population that colonizes the human body, chiefly in the <e14>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e14> and the <e15>@anatomical location$ mouth @/anatomical location$</e15>, called the microbiome.

Significant differences in the initial <e19>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e19> level and microbial composition were detected. Subsequently, the microbiota of each group was modulated by the administration of either a <e20>@dietary supplement$ probiotic @/dietary supplement$</e20>, fecal microbiota transplantation, or <e21>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e21>. Changes were observed in <e22>@DDF$ host anxiety levels @/DDF$</e22> in correlation to the shift of the <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23>. Our results suggest that the microbiota, host genetics, and <e24>@DDF$ psychological symptoms @/DDF$</e24> are strongly related, yet the deeper mechanistic links need further exploration."

      "abstract_tagged": "Emerging evidence from both clinical studies and animal models indicates the importance of the interaction between the <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e3> and the <e4>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e4> in the pathogenesis of <e5>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e5> (<e6>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e6>). Although how microbes modulate <e7>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e7> is still mostly unclear, recent studies have started to probe into the mechanisms for the communication between microbes and hosts in <e8>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e8>. In this review, we highlight the advantages of using <i><e9>@animal$ Caenorhabditis elegans @/animal$</e9></i> (<e10>@animal$ C. elegans @/animal$</e10>) to disentangle the microbe-host interaction that regulates <e11>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e11>. We summarize the microbial pro- and anti-neurodegenerative factors identified using the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models and the effects of many are confirmed in mouse models. Specifically, we focused on the role of <e12>@chemical$ bacterial amyloid proteins @/chemical$</e12>, such as <e13>@chemical$ curli @/chemical$</e13>, in promoting <e14>@DDF$ proteotoxicity @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e15> by cross-seeding the aggregation of <e16>@chemical$ endogenous ND-related proteins @/chemical$</e16>, such as <e17>@chemical$ \u03b1-synuclein @/chemical$</e17>. Targeting bacterial amyloid production may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating <e18>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e18>, and several compounds, such as <e19>@chemical$ epigallocatechin-3-gallate @/chemical$</e19> (<e20>@chemical$ EGCG @/chemical$</e20>), were shown to suppress <e21>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e21> at least partly by inhibiting curli production. Because <e22>@chemical$ bacterial amyloid fibrils @/chemical$</e22> contribute to <e23>@DDF$ biofilm formation @/DDF$</e23>, inhibition of amyloid production often leads to the disruption of biofilms. Interestingly, from a list of 59 compounds that showed neuroprotective effects in <i><e24>@animal$ C. elegans @/animal$</e24></i> and mouse ND models, we found that about half of them are known to inhibit <e25>@DDF$ bacterial @/DDF$</e25> growth or <e26>@DDF$ biofilm formation @/DDF$</e26>, suggesting a strong correlation between the neuroprotective and antibiofilm activities. Whether these potential therapeutics indeed protect <e27>@anatomical location$ neurons @/anatomical location$</e27> from <e28>@DDF$ proteotoxicity @/DDF$</e28> by inhibiting the cross-seeding between <e29>@chemical$ bacterial and human amyloid proteins @/chemical$</e29> awaits further investigations. Finally, we propose to screen the long list of <e30>@drug$ antibiofilm agents @/drug$</e30>, both <e31>@drug$ FDA-approved drugs @/drug$</e31> and <e32>@chemical$ novel compounds @/chemical$</e32>, for their neuroprotective effects and develop new pharmaceuticals that target the <e33>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e33> for the treatment of <e34>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e34>. To this end, the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models can serve as a platform for fast, high-throughput, and low-cost drug <e35>@biomedical technique$ screens @/biomedical technique$</e35> that target the microbe-host interaction in <e36>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e36>."

Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between <e9>@DDF$ gut microbiota dysbiosis @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e10> in <e11>@DDF$ AD progression @/DDF$</e11>. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during <e12>@DDF$ AD progression @/DDF$</e12>, the alteration of <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of <e14>@chemical$ phenylalanine @/chemical$</e14> and <e15>@chemical$ isoleucine @/chemical$</e15>, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to <e16>@DDF$ AD-associated neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e16>. Importantly, the elevation of <e17>@chemical$ phenylalanine @/chemical$</e17> and <e18>@chemical$ isoleucine @/chemical$</e18> concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of <e19>@human$ patients @/human$</e19> with <e20>@DDF$ mild cognitive impairment @/DDF$</e20> (<e21>@DDF$ MCI @/DDF$</e21>) due to <e22>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e22>. Furthermore, <e23>@drug$ GV-971 @/drug$</e23>, a <e24>@drug$ sodium oligomannate @/drug$</e24> that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses <e25>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e25> and the associated <e26>@chemical$ phenylalanine @/chemical$</e26>/<e27>@chemical$ isoleucine @/chemical$</e27> accumulation, harnesses <e28>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e28> and reverses the <e29>@DDF$ cognition impairment @/DDF$</e29>. Together, our findings highlight the role of <e30>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis-promoted neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e30> in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the <e31>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e31>."

      "abstract_tagged": "One of the key behavioral phenotypes in infancy are different temperament traits, and certain early life temperament traits have been shown to precede later <e3>@DDF$ mental health problems @/DDF$</e3>. Differences in the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiota composition @/microbiome$</e4> (<e5>@microbiome$ GMC @/microbiome$</e5>) have been suggested to link with neurodevelopment. For example, <e6>@human$ toddler @/human$</e6> temperament traits have been found to associate with differences in <e7>@microbiome$ GMC @/microbiome$</e7>; however, studies in <e8>@human$ infants @/human$</e8> are lacking although infancy is a rapid period of neurodevelopment as well as GM development. Thus, we aimed to investigate association between <e9>@microbiome$ infant GMC @/microbiome$</e9> and temperament. The study population (n\u202f=\u202f301, 53% <e10>@human$ boys @/human$</e10>) was drawn from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Stool samples were collected from the <e11>@human$ 2.5-month-old infants @/human$</e11> and sequenced with 16S Illumina MiSeq platform. <e12>@microbiome$ GMC @/microbiome$</e12> taxonomic composition (at Genus and OTU level), observed sample clusters, diversity and richness were investigated in relation to the maternal reports of <e13>@biomedical technique$ Infant Behavior Questionnaire -Revised @/biomedical technique$</e13> (<e14>@biomedical technique$ IBQ-R @/biomedical technique$</e14>) at the age of 6\u202fmonths.

Dispar @/bacteria$</e17>) based on <e18>@microbiome$ GMC @/microbiome$</e18> were identified, of which Bifidobacterium/Enterobacteriaceae-cluster presented with higher scores on the <e19>@biomedical technique$ IBQ-R @/biomedical technique$</e19> main dimension regulation and its subscale duration of orienting compared to Bacteroides-cluster. The clusters associated with temperament in a sex-dependent manner. The <e20>@biomedical technique$ IBQ-R @/biomedical technique$</e20> main dimension surgency (positive emotionality) was associated positively both with genus <e21>@bacteria$ Bifidobacterium @/bacteria$</e21> and <e22>@bacteria$ Streptococcus @/bacteria$</e22>. Alpha diversity had a negative association with negative emotionality and fear reactivity. This is the first study demonstrating associations, but not causal connections, between <e23>@microbiome$ GMC @/microbiome$</e23> and temperament in <e24>@human$ young infants @/human$</e24> in a prospective design."

      "abstract_tagged": "The last decade has witnessed a growing appreciation of the fundamental role played by an early assembly of a diverse and balanced <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e3> and its subsequent maintenance for future health of the host. <e4>@microbiome$ Gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> is currently viewed as a key regulator of a fluent bidirectional dialogue between the <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> and the <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> (gut-brain axis). A number of preclinical studies have suggested that the microbiota and its genome (microbiome) may play a key role in <e7>@DDF$ neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e7>. Furthermore, alterations in the gut microbiota composition in <e8>@human$ humans @/human$</e8> have also been linked to a variety of <e9>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric conditions @/DDF$</e9>, including <e10>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e10>, <e11>@DDF$ autism @/DDF$</e11> and <e12>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e12>. However, it is not yet clear whether these changes in the microbiome are causally related to such diseases or are secondary effects thereof. In this respect, recent studies in <e13>@animal$ animals @/animal$</e13> have indicated that gut microbiota transplantation can transfer a behavioral phenotype, suggesting that the <e14>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> may be a modifiable factor modulating the development or pathogenesis of <e15>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric conditions @/DDF$</e15>. Further studies are warranted to establish whether or not the findings of preclinical animal experiments can be generalized to <e16>@human$ humans @/human$</e16>. Moreover, although different communication routes between the <e17>@microbiome$ microbiota @/microbiome$</e17> and <e18>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e18> have been identified, further studies must elucidate all the underlying mechanisms involved. Such research is expected to contribute to the design of strategies to modulate the <e19>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e19> and its functions with a view to improving mental health, and thus provide opportunities to improve the management of <e20>@DDF$ psychiatric diseases @/DDF$</e20>. Here, we review the evidence supporting a role of the <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e21> in <e22>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e22> and the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying its contribution to <e23>@DDF$ mental illness @/DDF$</e23> and health. We also consider the stages of life where the <e24>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e24> is more susceptible to the effects of environmental stressors, and the possible microbiota-targeted intervention strategies that could improve health status and prevent <e25>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e25> in the near future."

The extraordinary complexity of the gut ecosystem, and how it interacts with the <e4>@anatomical location$ intestinal epithelium @/anatomical location$</e4> to manifest physiological changes in the <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> to influence mood and behaviour, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny over the last 2 decades. To further complicate matters, we each harbour a unique microbiota community that is subject to change by a number of factors including diet, exercise, <e6>@DDF$ stress @/DDF$</e6>, health status, genetics, medication, and age, amongst others. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a dynamic matrix of <e7>@anatomical location$ tissues @/anatomical location$</e7> and organs including the <e8>@microbiome$ gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota @/microbiome$</e8>, immune cells, <e9>@anatomical location$ gut tissue @/anatomical location$</e9>, <e10>@anatomical location$ glands @/anatomical location$</e10>, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the <e11>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e11> that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner through a number of anatomically and physiologically distinct systems. Long-term perturbations to this homeostatic environment may contribute to the progression of a number of disorders by altering physiological processes including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, neurotransmitter systems, immune function, and the inflammatory response. While an appropriate, co-ordinated physiological response, such as an immune or stress response, is necessary for survival, a dysfunctional response can be detrimental to the host, contributing to the development of a number of <e12>@DDF$ central nervous system disorders @/DDF$</e12>."

Studies have shown that the first years after the diagnosis are distressing in terms of adjustment to the disease and that <e8>@DDF$ MS @/DDF$</e8> negatively affects patients' psychological well-being, quality of life (QoL) and social functioning. However, the links between disease-specific variables at diagnosis, resilience and psychological adjustment of <e9>@human$ patients @/human$</e9> with <e10>@DDF$ MS @/DDF$</e10> remain largely unexplored, especially in <e11>@human$ adolescents @/human$</e11> and <e12>@human$ young adults @/human$</e12>. This observational study aims to fill the gap of knowledge on <u>b</u>io<u>p</u>sycho<u>s</u>ocial characteristics and <u>r</u>esilience of <e13>@human$ young <u>a</u>dults @/human$</e13> with <e14>@DDF$ MS @/DDF$</e14> to evaluate the relationship among these variables and to develop a biopsychosocial model of resilience. Biological and clinical characteristics of <e15>@human$ young adults @/human$</e15> newly diagnosed with <e16>@DDF$ MS @/DDF$</e16> will be investigated by collecting clinical information, performing <e17>@biomedical technique$ neurological examinations @/biomedical technique$</e17>, <e18>@biomedical technique$ MRI @/biomedical technique$</e18> and analysing <e19>@biomedical technique$ cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers @/biomedical technique$</e19> (eg, measures of <e20>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e20>), body composition, <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e21> and movement/perceptual markers. Psychosocial characteristics (eg, psychological distress, coping strategies), QoL, psychological well-being and resilience will be assessed by <e22>@biomedical technique$ self-report questionnaires @/biomedical technique$</e22>. <e23>@statistical technique$ Comparative statistics @/statistical technique$</e23> (ie, <e24>@statistical technique$ analysis of variance @/statistical technique$</e24> or <e25>@statistical technique$ unpaired samples t-test @/statistical technique$</e25>, <e26>@statistical technique$ correlation and regression analyses @/statistical technique$</e26>) will be applied to evaluate the relationship among biological, psychological and social factors. The results are expected to allow a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of resilience in <e27>@human$ young patients @/human$</e27> with <e28>@DDF$ MS @/DDF$</e28> and to inform resilience interventions, tailored to young patients' specific needs, aiming to reduce the risk of maladaptive reactions to the disease and to improve psychological well-being and QoL. The study has been approved by the Verona University Hospital Ethics Committee (approval number: 2029CESC). The findings will be disseminated through scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, social media and specific websites. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03825055)."

This axis has been suggested to play a role in several <e3>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e3>, such as <e4>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e4>, <e5>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e5>, <e6>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e6>, and <e7>@DDF$ epilepsy @/DDF$</e7>, paving the way for microbiome-based intervention strategies for the mitigation and treatment of symptoms. <e8>@DDF$ Epilepsy @/DDF$</e8> is a multifaceted neurological condition affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide, 30% of whom do not respond to conventional pharmacological therapies. Among the first-hand microbiota modulation strategies, nutritional interventions represent an easily applicable option in both clinical and home settings. In this narrative review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis involvement in <e9>@DDF$ epilepsy @/DDF$</e9>, discuss the impact of <e10>@drug$ antiepileptic drugs @/drug$</e10> on the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e11>, and then the impact of a particular dietary pattern, the ketogenic diet, on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in <e12>@human$ epileptic patients @/human$</e12>. The investigation of the microbiota response to non-pharmacological therapies is an ever-expanding field with the potential to allow the design of increasingly accessible and successful intervention strategies."

Several studies have analyzed the <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e10> in <e11>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e11>, but a consensus on the features of the <e12>@microbiome$ PD-specific microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> is missing.

We found significant alterations in the <e15>@microbiome$ PD-associated microbiome @/microbiome$</e15>, which are robust to study-specific technical heterogeneities, although differences in microbiome structure between <e16>@human$ PD and controls @/human$</e16> are small.

      "abstract_tagged": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of <e2>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e2>, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. <e3>@drug$ (R)-ketamine @/drug$</e3> has a greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than <e4>@drug$ (S)-ketamine @/drug$</e4>. Here, we investigated whether the <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e5> plays a role in the antidepressant effects of these two <e6>@drug$ ketamine enantiomers @/drug$</e6>. The role of the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> in the antidepressant effects of <e8>@drug$ ketamine enantiomers @/drug$</e8> in a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of <e9>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e9> was examined using <e10>@biomedical technique$ 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e10> of fecal samples. At the phylum level, <e11>@animal$ CSDS-susceptible mice @/animal$</e11> showed alterations in the levels of <e12>@bacteria$ Tenericutes @/bacteria$</e12> and <e13>@bacteria$ Actinobacteria @/bacteria$</e13>; however, neither <e14>@drug$ ketamine enantiomers @/drug$</e14> influenced these alterations. At the class level, both <e15>@drug$ ketamine enantiomers @/drug$</e15> significantly attenuated the increase in the levels of <e16>@bacteria$ Deltaproteobacteria @/bacteria$</e16> in the <e17>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e17> after CSDS. Furthermore, <e18>@drug$ (R)-ketamine @/drug$</e18>, but not <e19>@drug$ (S)-ketamine @/drug$</e19>, significantly attenuated the reduction in the levels of <e20>@bacteria$ Mollicutes @/bacteria$</e20> in the <e21>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e21>. At the genus level, both <e22>@drug$ ketamine enantiomers @/drug$</e22> significantly attenuated the decrease in the levels of <e23>@bacteria$ Butyricimonas @/bacteria$</e23> in the <e24>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e24>. Notably, <e25>@drug$ (R)-ketamine @/drug$</e25> was more potent than <e26>@drug$ (S)-ketamine @/drug$</e26> at reducing the levels of <e27>@bacteria$ Butyricimonas @/bacteria$</e27> in the <e28>@animal$ susceptible mice @/animal$</e28>. In conclusion, this study suggests that the antidepressant effects of two enantiomers of <e29>@drug$ ketamine @/drug$</e29> in CSDS model may be partly mediated by the restoration of the <e30>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e30>. Furthermore, the specific effect of <e31>@drug$ (R)-ketamine @/drug$</e31> on the levels of <e32>@bacteria$ Mollicutes @/bacteria$</e32> and <e33>@bacteria$ Butyricimonas @/bacteria$</e33> may explain its robust antidepressant action."

      "abstract_tagged": "The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of <e4>@DDF$ stress-related psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e4>; however, its role in the resilience versus susceptibility after <e5>@DDF$ stress @/DDF$</e5> remains unclear. Dietary nutrient <e6>@dietary supplement$ betaine @/dietary supplement$</e6> is suggested to affect the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e7>. Here, we examined whether <e8>@dietary supplement$ betaine supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e8> can affect anhedonia-like phenotype in <e9>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e9> subjected to <e10>@DDF$ chronic social defeat stress @/DDF$</e10> (<e11>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e11>). <e12>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e12> was performed during <e13>@dietary supplement$ betaine supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e13>. <e14>@biomedical technique$ Sucrose preference test @/biomedical technique$</e14> and <e15>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA analysis @/biomedical technique$</e15> of fecal samples were performed. <e16>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e16> did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the <e17>@animal$ betaine-treated mice @/animal$</e17>, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in <e18>@animal$ water-treated mice @/animal$</e18>. Furthermore, <e19>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e19> treatment did not alter the plasma levels of <e20>@chemical$ interleukin-6 @/chemical$</e20> (<e21>@chemical$ IL-6 @/chemical$</e21>) of <e22>@animal$ betaine-treated mice @/animal$</e22> whereas <e23>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e23> caused higher plasma levels of <e24>@chemical$ IL-6 @/chemical$</e24> in <e25>@animal$ water-treated mice @/animal$</e25>. <e26>@dietary supplement$ Betaine supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e26> ameliorated the abnormal diversity and composition of the microbiota in the <e27>@anatomical location$ host gut @/anatomical location$</e27> after <e28>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e28>. At the genus level, <e29>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e29> caused marked increases in the several bacteria of <e30>@animal$ water-treated mice @/animal$</e30>, but not <e31>@animal$ betaine-treated mice @/animal$</e31>. <e32>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e32> increased levels of <e33>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e33> (i.e., <e34>@chemical$ succinic acid @/chemical$</e34> and <e35>@chemical$ acetic acid @/chemical$</e35>) in feces from <e36>@animal$ water-treated mice @/animal$</e36>, but not <e37>@animal$ betaine-treated mice @/animal$</e37>. Interestingly, there are positive correlations between <e38>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e38> (i.e., <e39>@chemical$ succinic acid @/chemical$</e39>, <e40>@chemical$ acetic acid @/chemical$</e40>, <e41>@chemical$ butyric acid @/chemical$</e41>) and several bacteria among the groups. Specific microbiome were not determined. These findings suggest that <e42>@dietary supplement$ betaine supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e42> contributed to resilience to <e43>@DDF$ anhedonia @/DDF$</e43> in <e44>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e44> subjected to <e45>@DDF$ CSDS @/DDF$</e45> through anti-inflammation action. Therefore, it is likely that <e46>@dietary supplement$ betaine @/dietary supplement$</e46> could be a prophylactic nutrient to prevent <e47>@DDF$ stress-related psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e47>."

The factors that were significantly correlated with efficacy were used to predict the treatment response. The differences in the importance of microbiota and genetics in prediction were analyzed. Our study identified <e10>@gene$ rs58010457 @/gene$</e10> as a potentially key locus affecting the treatment effect. Different microbiota and enriched pathways might play different roles in the response after two and eight weeks. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) value was greater than 0.8 for both <e11>@statistical technique$ random forest models @/statistical technique$</e11>. The contribution of different components to the AUC was evaluated by removing genetic information, microbiota abundance, and pathway data. The <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e12> was an important predictor of the response after eight weeks, while genetics was an important predictor of the response after two weeks. These results suggested a dynamic effect of interaction among genetics and gut microbes on treatment. Furthermore, these results provide new guidance for clinical decisions: in cases of inadequate treatment effects after two weeks, the composition of the <e13>@microbiome$ intestinal flora @/microbiome$</e13> can be improved by diet therapy, which could ultimately affect the efficacy."

Despite their high prevalence and mental health impact, affective pathogenesis is poorly understood, and often remains recurrent and resistant to treatment. The lack of efficient <e6>@drug$ antidepressants @/drug$</e6> and presently limited conceptual innovation necessitate novel approaches and new drug targets in the field of antidepressant therapy. Areas covered: Herein, the authors discuss the emerging role of neuro-immune interactions in affective pathogenesis, which can become useful targets for CNS drug discovery, including modulating neuroinflammatory pathways to alleviate <e7>@DDF$ affective pathogenesis @/DDF$</e7>. Expert opinion: Mounting evidence implicates microglia, <e8>@chemical$ polyunsaturated fatty acids @/chemical$</e8> (<e9>@chemical$ PUFAs @/chemical$</e9>), <e10>@chemical$ glucocorticoids @/chemical$</e10> and <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> in both <e12>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e12> and <e13>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e13>. It is suggested that novel <e14>@drug$ antidepressants @/drug$</e14> can be developed based on targeting microglia-, PUFAs-, glucocorticoid- and gut microbiota-mediated cellular pathways. In addition, the authors call for a wider application of novel model organisms, such as <e15>@animal$ zebrafish @/animal$</e15>, in studying shared, evolutionarily conserved (and therefore, core) neuro-immune mechanisms of <e16>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e16>."

Unfortunately, many <e5>@human$ people @/human$</e5> with <e6>@DDF$ celiac disease @/DDF$</e6> report poor quality of life (QoL) despite following a strict GFD, and up to 30% still report negative symptoms (eg, <e7>@DDF$ gastrointestinal upset @/DDF$</e7>). The purpose of the MOVE-C (understanding the relationship between the <i>M</i>icrobi<i>O</i>me, <i>V</i>itality, and <i>E</i>xercise in <e8>@DDF$ <i>C</i>eliac disease @/DDF$</e8>) pilot study is to explore the effects of a 12-week supervised progressive high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and lifestyle intervention on physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes among <e9>@human$ inactive adults @/human$</e9> with <e10>@DDF$ celiac disease @/DDF$</e10>.<b>Methods/Design:</b> Sixty <e11>@human$ inactive adults @/human$</e11> diagnosed with <e12>@DDF$ celiac disease @/DDF$</e12> will be randomized to HIIT+ or waitlist control (WLC). Participants in the HIIT+ will engage in a 12-week HIIT\u2009+\u2009lifestyle education program. HIIT sessions will be comprised of 2 workouts per week, working up to 14\u2009\u00d7\u200930-second intervals at 90% maximal heart rate (HRmax) followed by 2 minutes recovery at 50% HRmax. The 6 biweekly lifestyle sessions will involve education on the promotion of a whole foods GFD, sleep hygiene, psychosocial coping skills (eg, self-compassion), and self-regulatory skills to master changes in behaviors. Assessments will occur at pre and post 12-week intervention and 3-month follow-up. WLC participants will be offered a 12-week HIIT program\u2009+\u2009online lifestyle education sessions after completing the final assessment. The primary outcomes are QoL and gut microbiota composition assessed with <e13>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13>. The secondary outcomes are markers of <e14>@DDF$ metabolic syndrome @/DDF$</e14> (waist circumference, fasting glucose, <e15>@chemical$ serum lipids @/chemical$</e15>, blood pressure, and body composition), <e16>@DDF$ gastrointestinal symptoms @/DDF$</e16>, sleep quality, adherence to a GFD, exercise behavior, self-regulatory efficacy, and self-compassion. It is hypothesized that <e17>@human$ participants @/human$</e17> in the HIIT+ will experience improvements in all outcomes when compared to those in the WLC. These improvements are expected to be maintained at the 3-month follow-up. The findings from this study will advance the knowledge regarding the effects of HIIT and lifestyle education on key outcomes for an at-risk chronic disease population. Furthermore, the findings can be used to inform future programs to improve fitness and physical and mental health outcomes for <e18>@human$ people @/human$</e18> with <e19>@DDF$ celiac disease @/DDF$</e19>."

Recently, there has been a growing focus on the relationship between the <e10>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e10> and the development of <e11>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e11>. Emerging to the forefront, an interesting concept has developed suggesting that the <e12>@DDF$ initial pathophysiological changes @/DDF$</e12> occur in the <e13>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e13> before changes are seen within the <e14>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e14>. This review is aimed at highlighting the relationship between <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15> and the <e16>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal tract @/anatomical location$</e16>, along with the supporting evidence for this. Firstly, we will focus on the <e17>@DDF$ gastrointestinal conditions and symptoms @/DDF$</e17> which commonly affects <e18>@human$ patients @/human$</e18>, including both <e19>@DDF$ upper and lower gastrointestinal issues @/DDF$</e19>. Secondly, the impact of nutrition and diet on neurological health and PD physiology, with particular emphasis on commonly consumed items including <e20>@chemical$ macronutrients @/chemical$</e20> and <e21>@chemical$ micronutrients @/chemical$</e21>. Finally, variability of the <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e22> will also be discussed and its link with both the symptoms and signs of <e23>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e23>. The evidence presented in this review highly suggests that the initial pathogenesis in the <e24>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e24> may proceed the development of <e25>@DDF$ prodromal PD subtypes @/DDF$</e25>, and therefore building on this further could be imperative and lead to earlier diagnosis with new and improved therapeutics."

Our distance measure used for clustering is derived from a parametric based mixture model producing sample-specific distributions conditional on the observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts and estimated mixture weights. The method can provide accurate estimates of the true zero proportions and thus construct a precise beta diversity measure. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted and suggest that the proposed method achieves substantial clustering improvement compared with some widely used distance measures when a large proportion of zeros is presented. The proposed algorithm was implemented to a human gut microbiome study on <e7>@DDF$ Parkinson's diseases @/DDF$</e7> to identify distinct microbiome states with biological interpretations."

It becomes clear from the limited data that exist that there is a fine line between acceleration and inhibition, but that cross-reactivity is widespread, and it is more common for other proteins (among the studied cases) to accelerate alpha-synuclein amyloid formation than to block it. It is of high importance to expand investigations of cross-reactivity between <e21>@chemical$ amyloidogenic proteins @/chemical$</e21> to both reveal underlying mechanisms and links between <e22>@DDF$ human diseases @/DDF$</e22>, as well as to develop new treatments that may be based on an altered <e23>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e23>."

The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between <e9>@human$ patients @/human$</e9> diagnosed with <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10> and treated only with <e11>@drug$ Levodopa @/drug$</e11> to <e12>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e12>. In this prospective study, <e13>@human$ patients @/human$</e13> were recruited in 1 academic hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. The detailed demographic data and medical history were collected using a set of questionnaires. Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. <e14>@biomedical technique$ Next-Generation Sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e14> was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e15>. In this study, we enrolled 27 <e16>@human$ hospitalized PD patients @/human$</e16> with <e17>@DDF$ well-controlled symptoms @/DDF$</e17>. The control group included 44 <e18>@human$ healthy subjects @/human$</e18> matched for age. Among <e19>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e19>, our results presented a higher abundance of <i><e20>@bacteria$ Bacteroides</i> phylum @/bacteria$</e20>, class <i><e21>@bacteria$ Corynebacteria @/bacteria$</e21></i> among phylum <i><e22>@bacteria$ Actinobacteria @/bacteria$</e22></i>, class <i><e23>@bacteria$ Deltaproteobacteria @/bacteria$</e23></i> among phylum <i><e24>@bacteria$ Proteobacteria @/bacteria$</e24></i>, and genera such as <i><e25>@bacteria$ Butyricimonas @/bacteria$</e25>, <e26>@bacteria$ Robinsoniella @/bacteria$</e26></i>, and <i><e27>@bacteria$ Flavonifractor @/bacteria$</e27></i>. The species <i><e28>@bacteria$ Akkermansia muciniphila @/bacteria$</e28></i>, <i><e29>@bacteria$ Eubacterium biforme @/bacteria$</e29></i>, and <i><e30>@bacteria$ Parabacteroides merdae @/bacteria$</e30></i> were identified as more common in the <e31>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e31> of <e32>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e32>. In conclusion, the <e33>@human$ patients @/human$</e33> diagnosed with <e34>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e34> have significantly different gut microbiota profiles in comparison with <e35>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e35>."

The <e7>@anatomical location$ vermiform appendix @/anatomical location$</e7> is a lymphoid tissue in the <e8>@anatomical location$ cecum @/anatomical location$</e8> implicated in the storage and regulation of the <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9>. We sought to determine whether the <e10>@microbiome$ appendix microbiome @/microbiome$</e10> is altered in <e11>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e11> and to analyze the biological consequences of the microbial alterations. We investigated the changes in the <e12>@microbiome$ functional microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> in the <e13>@anatomical location$ appendix @/anatomical location$</e13> of <e14>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e14> relative to <e15>@human$ controls @/human$</e15> (<i>n</i> = 12 PD, 16 C) by <e16>@biomedical technique$ metatranscriptomic analysis @/biomedical technique$</e16>. We found <e17>@DDF$ microbial dysbiosis @/DDF$</e17> affecting lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of <e18>@bacteria$ bacteria responsible for secondary bile acid synthesis @/bacteria$</e18>. We then quantitatively measure changes in bile acid abundance in <e19>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e19> relative to the <e20>@human$ controls @/human$</e20> in the <e21>@anatomical location$ appendix @/anatomical location$</e21> (<i>n</i> = 15 PD, 12 C) and <e22>@anatomical location$ ileum @/anatomical location$</e22> (<i>n</i> = 20 PD, 20 C). <e23>@biomedical technique$ Bile acid analysis @/biomedical technique$</e23> in the <e24>@anatomical location$ PD appendix @/anatomical location$</e24> reveals an increase in <e25>@chemical$ hydrophobic and secondary bile acids @/chemical$</e25>, <e26>@chemical$ deoxycholic acid @/chemical$</e26> (<e27>@chemical$ DCA @/chemical$</e27>) and <e28>@chemical$ lithocholic acid @/chemical$</e28> (<e29>@chemical$ LCA @/chemical$</e29>).

An increasing body of preclinical and clinical evidence has revealed that the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbial ecosystem @/microbiome$</e4> can affect\u00a0neuropsychiatric health.

The relationship of stress-induced adaptations (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the immune system) and the microbiota are potential contributors to <e4>@DDF$ psychopathology @/DDF$</e4> exhibited in <e5>@human$ women during pregnancy and postpartum @/human$</e5> and should be investigated. The stress response activates the HPA axis and dysregulates the ANS, leading to the inhibition of the parasympathetic system. Sustained high levels of <e6>@chemical$ cortisol @/chemical$</e6>, reduced heart variability, and modulated immune responses increase the vulnerability to <e7>@DDF$ PMAD @/DDF$</e7>. Bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the microbiota is an important factor to alter host homeostasis and development of <e8>@DDF$ PMAD @/DDF$</e8>. Future research in the relationship between the psychoneuroimmune system, the <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e9>, and <e10>@DDF$ PMAD @/DDF$</e10> has the potential to be integrated in clinical practice to improve screening, diagnosis, and treatment."

Changes in diet around the world mean that <e3>@human$ populations @/human$</e3> are now increasingly reliant on <e4>@food$ highly processed, poor quality foods @/food$</e4>, which have been linked to increased risk for <e5>@DDF$ mental disorder @/DDF$</e5>. Conversely, a <e6>@food$ nutrient-rich diet @/food$</e6> is understood to be protective of mental health, and researchers are now aiming to understand the biological underpinnings of this relationship. The <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> has been proposed as a key mediator of this link, given its association with both diet and mental health. Importantly, several critical \"windows of opportunity\" for prevention and intervention have been identified, particularly early life and adolescence; these are periods of rapid development and transition that provide a foundation for future health. Strategies that promote overall diet quality, high in <e8>@dietary supplement$ fiber @/dietary supplement$</e8> and <e9>@food$ nutrients @/food$</e9>, have been linked to increased microbial diversity and gut health. Improving diet quality and subsequent gut health may have benefits for individuals' mental health, as well as the mental health of future generations. Here we discuss specific, targeted dietary and gut focused strategies for the prevention and treatment of <e10>@DDF$ mental disorder @/DDF$</e10>."

Study selection, risk of bias appraisal, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. <e17>@statistical technique$ Pooled mean differences @/statistical technique$</e17> (<e18>@statistical technique$ MD @/statistical technique$</e18>) and <e19>@statistical technique$ odds ratios @/statistical technique$</e19> (pOR) with <e20>@statistical technique$ 95% confidence intervals @/statistical technique$</e20> (CI) were calculated in <e21>@statistical technique$ random-effects meta-analyses @/statistical technique$</e21> for the outcomes of interest in the review. <b>Results:</b> From 3,868 studies identified through the search strategy, three RCTs of low risk of bias involving 713 <e22>@human$ participants @/human$</e22> were included, all three testing <e23>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e23>. There were no differences between <e24>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e24> and <e25>@human$ control groups @/human$</e25> in the mean depression scores (MD -0.46; 95% CI -2.16, 1.25) at end of follow-up. Although statistical significance was not achieved, <e26>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e26> showed an advantage in the proportion of participants scoring below an established cut-off for <e27>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e27> (pOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.43, 1.07).

There is a lack of RCT evidence supporting prebiotics and synbiotics supplementation for similar purposes in the perinatal period. More research is needed before prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics are recommended to support maternal mental health and well-being in the perinatal period. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO, CRD42019137158."

      "abstract_tagged": "The <e4>@microbiome$ human gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e5> and <e6>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e6> is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, <e7>@DDF$ microbial dysbiosis @/DDF$</e7> - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the <e8>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e8> is implicated in the pathogenesis of several <e9>@DDF$ chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e9>. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with <e10>@DDF$ neurodegenerative conditions @/DDF$</e10> have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. <e11>@DDF$ Dysbiosis @/DDF$</e11> is also linked to <e12>@DDF$ psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications @/DDF$</e12> - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of <e13>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e13> (<e14>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e14>) and <e15>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e15> (<e16>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e16>). Studies have identified potential mediators that link <e17>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e17> and <e18>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e18>. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of <e19>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e19>. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly <e20>@DDF$ gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation @/DDF$</e20>, <e21>@DDF$ protein misfolding @/DDF$</e21>, propagation of <e22>@DDF$ disease-specific pathology @/DDF$</e22>, <e23>@DDF$ defective protein clearance @/DDF$</e23>, and <e24>@DDF$ autoimmune dysregulation @/DDF$</e24>, linking <e25>@DDF$ gut microbial dysbiosis @/DDF$</e25> and <e26>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e26>. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer <e27>@chemical$ beneficial metabolites @/chemical$</e27>, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and <e28>@DDF$ enteric neuronal dysfunction @/DDF$</e28>. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the <e29>@DDF$ systemic pro-inflammatory state @/DDF$</e29>, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to <e30>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e30> and <e31>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e31>. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of <e32>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e32> and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases."

This initial trauma is accompanied by a set of biological mechanisms directed to ameliorate <e4>@DDF$ neural damage @/DDF$</e4> but also exacerbate initial damage (secondary injury). The alterations that occur in the <e5>@anatomical location$ spinal cord @/anatomical location$</e5> have not only local but also systemic consequences and virtually all organs and tissues of the body incur important changes after <e6>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e6>, explaining the progression and detrimental consequences related to this condition. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE) is a growing area of research aiming to integrate and explore the interactions among the different systems that compose the human organism, considering the mind and the body as a whole. The initial traumatic event and the consequent <e7>@DDF$ neurological disruption @/DDF$</e7> trigger <e8>@DDF$ immune, endocrine, and multisystem dysfunction @/DDF$</e8>, which in turn affect the patient's psyche and well-being. In the present review, we will explore the most important local and systemic consequences of <e9>@DDF$ SCI @/DDF$</e9> from a PNIE perspective, defining the changes occurring in each system and how all these mechanisms are interconnected. Finally, potential clinical approaches derived from this knowledge will also be collectively presented with the aim to develop integrative therapies to maximize the clinical management of these <e10>@human$ patients @/human$</e10>."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e2>@DDF$ Anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e2> in <e3>@animal$ dogs @/animal$</e3> are ever-growing and represent an important concern in the veterinary behavior field. These disorders are often disregarded in veterinary clinical practice, negatively impacting the animal's and owner's quality of life. Moreover, these <e4>@DDF$ anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e4> can potentially result in the abandonment or euthanasia of <e5>@animal$ dogs @/animal$</e5>. Growing evidence shows that the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> is a central player in the gut-brain axis. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the <e7>@anatomical location$ intestines @/anatomical location$</e7> of <e8>@animal$ dogs @/animal$</e8>, which are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These microbes can impact mental health through several mechanisms, including metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immune-mediated pathways. The disruption of a balanced composition of resident commensal communities, or <e9>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e9>, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including <e10>@DDF$ mental disorders @/DDF$</e10> such as <e11>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e11>. Studies carried out in rodent models and <e12>@human$ humans @/human$</e12> demonstrate that the <e13>@microbiome$ intestinal microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> can influence mental health through these mechanisms, including <e14>@DDF$ anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e14>. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies using <e15>@dietary supplement$ prebiotics @/dietary supplement$</e15> and <e16>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e16> have been shown to ameliorate anxiety-related symptoms. However, regarding the canine veterinary behavior field, there is still a lack of insightful research on this topic. In this review, we explore the few but relevant studies performed on <e17>@DDF$ canine anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e17>. We agree that innovative bacterial therapeutical approaches for <e18>@DDF$ canine anxiety disorders @/DDF$</e18> will become a promising field of investigation and certainly pave the way for new approaches to these behavioral conditions."

Both age and <e7>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e7> share common metabolic hallmarks such as <e8>@DDF$ increased oxidative stress @/DDF$</e8> and <e9>@DDF$ perturbed metabolic function @/DDF$</e9>, and age remains the most strongly correlated risk factor for <e10>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e10>, a <e11>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disease @/DDF$</e11>. A <e12>@DDF$ major accompanying pathological symptom @/DDF$</e12> of these conditions is <e13>@DDF$ cognitive impairment @/DDF$</e13>, which is linked with <e14>@DDF$ changes in lipid metabolism @/DDF$</e14>. Thus, <e15>@dietary supplement$ nutraceuticals @/dietary supplement$</e15> that affect brain lipid metabolism or lipid levels as a whole have the potential to ameliorate <e16>@DDF$ cognitive decline @/DDF$</e16>. <e17>@biomedical technique$ Lipid analyses @/biomedical technique$</e17> and <e18>@biomedical technique$ lipidomic studies @/biomedical technique$</e18> reveal changes in specific lipid types with aging and <e19>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e19>, which can identify potential <e20>@dietary supplement$ lipid-based nutraceuticals @/dietary supplement$</e20> to restore the <e21>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e21> to a healthy lipid phenotype. The brain lipid profile can be influenced directly with dietary administration of <e22>@dietary supplement$ lipids @/dietary supplement$</e22> themselves, although because of synergistic effects of nutrients it may be more useful to consider a <e23>@food$ multi-component diet @/food$</e23> rather than <e24>@dietary supplement$ single nutrient supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e24>. <e25>@microbiome$ Gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e25> also serve as a source of <e26>@chemical$ beneficial lipids @/chemical$</e26>, and the value of treatments that manipulate the composition of <e27>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e27> should not be ignored. Lastly, instead of direct supplementation, compounds that affect pathways involved with lipid metabolism should also be considered as a way of manipulating lipid levels to improve cognition.

Recent evidence posits that <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8> may initiate in the <e9>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e9> by microbes or their toxins that promote <e10>@DDF$ chronic gut inflammation @/DDF$</e10> that will ultimately impact the <e11>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e11>. In this work, we sought to demonstrate that the effects of the <e12>@chemical$ microbial toxin \u03b2-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine @/chemical$</e12> (<e13>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e13>) in the <e14>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e14> may trigger some <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15> cases, which is especially worrying as this toxin is present in certain foods but not routinely monitored by public health authorities. To test the hypothesis, we treated <e16>@animal$ wild-type mice @/animal$</e16>, primary neuronal cultures, cell lines and isolated mitochondria with <e17>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e17>, and analysed its impact on <e18>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e18> composition, barrier permeability, <e19>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e19> and aSyn aggregation as well as in <e20>@DDF$ brain inflammation @/DDF$</e20>, <e21>@DDF$ dopaminergic neuronal loss @/DDF$</e21> and motor behaviour. To further examine the key role of mitochondria, we also determined the specific effects of <e22>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e22> on mitochondrial function and on inflammasome activation. <e23>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e23> induced extensive depletion of <e24>@bacteria$ segmented filamentous bacteria @/bacteria$</e24> (<e25>@bacteria$ SFB @/bacteria$</e25>) that regulate gut immunity, thus triggering <e26>@DDF$ gut dysbiosis @/DDF$</e26>, <e27>@DDF$ immune cell migration @/DDF$</e27>, increased <e28>@DDF$ intestinal inflammation @/DDF$</e28>, <e29>@DDF$ loss of barrier integrity @/DDF$</e29> and caudo-rostral progression of aSyn. Additionally, <e30>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e30> induced <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> mitochondrial dysfunction with <e31>@chemical$ cardiolipin @/chemical$</e31> exposure and consequent activation of neuronal innate immunity. These events primed <e32>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e32>, <e33>@DDF$ dopaminergic neuronal loss @/DDF$</e33> and <e34>@DDF$ motor deficits @/DDF$</e34>. Taken together, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to dietary <e35>@chemical$ BMAA @/chemical$</e35> can trigger a chain of events that recapitulate the evolution of the <e36>@DDF$ PD pathology @/DDF$</e36> from the <e37>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e37> to the <e38>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e38>, which is consistent with <e39>@DDF$ 'gut-first' PD @/DDF$</e39>."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e4>@chemical$ Gut-microbiome-derived metabolites @/chemical$</e4>, such as <e5>@chemical$ 4-Ethylphenol @/chemical$</e5> [<e6>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e6>], have been shown to modulate neurological health and function. Although the source of such metabolites is becoming better understood, knowledge gaps remain as to the mechanisms by which they enter host circulation, how they are transported in the body, how they are metabolised and excreted, and the way they exert their effects. High blood concentrations of <e7>@chemical$ host-modified 4EP @/chemical$</e7>, <e8>@chemical$ 4-ethylphenol sulfate @/chemical$</e8> [<e9>@chemical$ 4EPS @/chemical$</e9>], are associated with an <e10>@DDF$ anxiety phenotype @/DDF$</e10> in <e11>@human$ autistic individuals @/human$</e11>. We have reviewed the existing literature and discuss mechanisms that are proposed to contribute influx from the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e12>, metabolism, and excretion of <e13>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e13>. We note that <e14>@DDF$ increased intestinal permeability @/DDF$</e14> is common in <e15>@human$ autistic individuals @/human$</e15>, potentially explaining increased flux of <e16>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e16> and/or <e17>@chemical$ 4EPS @/chemical$</e17> across the <e18>@anatomical location$ gut epithelium @/anatomical location$</e18> and the Blood Brain Barrier [BBB]. Similarly, <e19>@DDF$ kidney dysfunction @/DDF$</e19>, another complication observed in <e20>@human$ autistic individuals @/human$</e20>, impacts clearance of <e21>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e21> and its derivatives from circulation. Evidence indicates that accumulation of <e22>@chemical$ 4EPS @/chemical$</e22> in the <e23>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e23> of <e24>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e24> affects connectivity between subregions, particularly those linked to <e25>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e25>. However, we found no data on the presence or quantity of <e26>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e26> and/or <e27>@chemical$ 4EPS @/chemical$</e27> in <e28>@anatomical location$ human brains @/anatomical location$</e28>, irrespective of neurological status, likely due to challenges sampling this organ. We argue that the penetrative ability of <e29>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e29> is dependent on its form at the BBB and its physicochemical similarity to <e30>@chemical$ endogenous metabolites @/chemical$</e30> with dedicated active transport mechanisms across the BBB. We conclude that future research should focus on physical (e.g., ingestion of sorbents) or metabolic mechanisms (e.g., conversion to <e31>@chemical$ 4EP-glucuronide @/chemical$</e31>) that are capable of being used as interventions to reduce the flux of <e32>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e32> from the <e33>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e33> into the body, increase the efflux of <e34>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e34> and/or <e35>@chemical$ 4EPS @/chemical$</e35> from the <e36>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e36>, or increase excretion from the <e37>@anatomical location$ kidneys @/anatomical location$</e37> as a means of addressing the neurological impacts of <e38>@chemical$ 4EP @/chemical$</e38>."

      "abstract_tagged": "The gut-brain axis may play a central role in the pathogenesis of <e3>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e3>. Dozens of case-control studies have been carried out to identify bacterial markers by the use of targeted metagenomics. Alterations of several taxonomic profiles have been confirmed across several populations, however, no consensus has been made regarding alpha-diversity. A recent publication has described and validated a novel method based on richness and evenness measures of the <e4>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e4> in order to reduce the complexity and multiplicity of alpha-diversity indices. We used these recently described richness and evenness composite measures to investigate the potential link between <e5>@DDF$ gut microbiome alpha-diversity @/DDF$</e5> and <e6>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e6> and to determine to what extent it could be used as a marker to diagnose <e7>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e7> from stool samples. We performed an exhaustive review of the literature to identify original published clinical studies including <e8>@biomedical technique$ 16S rRNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e8> on <e9>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e9>, <e10>@DDF$ multiple Sclerosis @/DDF$</e10> and <e11>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e11>. Richness and evenness factors loadings were quantified from sequencing files in addition with the <e12>@statistical technique$ Shannon diversity index @/statistical technique$</e12>.

Five studies were meta-analysed for <e19>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e19>, corresponding to 303 subjects (164 <e20>@DDF$ Multiple Sclerosis @/DDF$</e20>/139 <e21>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e21>). For <e22>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e22>, the <e23>@statistical technique$ meta-analysis @/statistical technique$</e23> was not done as only two studies matched our criteria. Neither richness nor evenness was significantly altered in <e24>@human$ Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis patients @/human$</e24> in comparison to <e25>@human$ healthy controls @/human$</e25> (<i>P</i>-value\u2009>\u20090.05). <e26>@statistical technique$ Shannon index @/statistical technique$</e26> was neither associated with <e27>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e27> (<i>P</i>-value\u2009>\u20090.05). After adjusting for age and sex, none of the alpha-diversity measures were associated with <e28>@DDF$ Parkinson's Disease @/DDF$</e28>. This is the first report investigating systematically alpha-diversity and its potential link to <e29>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e29>. Our study has demonstrated that unlike in other <e30>@DDF$ gastro-intestinal, immune and metabolic disorders @/DDF$</e30>, loss of bacterial diversity is not associated with <e31>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e31> and <e32>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e32>."

In the present investigation we examined whether microbial changes in cecum contents were associated with <e7>@DDF$ social avoidance behaviors @/DDF$</e7>, a feature of <e8>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e8>, and <e9>@DDF$ pro-inflammatory variations @/DDF$</e9> among <e10>@animal$ socially stressed mice @/animal$</e10>. <e11>@animal$ Male C57BL/6 mice @/animal$</e11> experienced social defeat or a control condition once a day for 10 consecutive days. <e12>@DDF$ Social avoidance behaviors @/DDF$</e12> were examined three weeks after the last defeat or control episode and blood, brain, and cecum contents were collected 24h afterward for the determination of <e13>@chemical$ corticosterone @/chemical$</e13>, <e14>@chemical$ pro-inflammatory cytokines @/chemical$</e14>, and microbial populations. <e15>@animal$ Mice @/animal$</e15> that were most susceptible to the behavioral effects of <e16>@DDF$ chronic social defeat @/DDF$</e16> (reflected by <e17>@DDF$ severe social avoidance behaviors @/DDF$</e17>) displayed the greatest changes within particular sets of bacteria at the phylum and genus taxonomic ranks. Although <e18>@chemical$ plasma and brain cytokines @/chemical$</e18> were not significantly altered in <e19>@animal$ socially defeated mice @/animal$</e19>, changes in the mRNA expression of <e20>@chemical$ interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 @/chemical$</e20> and <e21>@chemical$ IL-6 @/chemical$</e21> within the <e22>@anatomical location$ prefrontal cortex @/anatomical location$</e22> were associated with elevated abundance of <e23>@bacteria$ Flavobacterium spp. @/bacteria$</e23> and reduced abundance of <e24>@bacteria$ Turicibacter spp. @/bacteria$</e24>, which were also strongly correlated to social avoidance severity. Although at this time a causal connection cannot be inferred, these results point to the possibility that specific clusters of bacterial communities in cecum contents may be linked to vulnerability to <e25>@DDF$ social deficits @/DDF$</e25> stemming from prolonged social stressor experiences."

While <e26>@chemical$ EGCG @/chemical$</e26> exhibits potential antidepressant properties, a higher dosage of 3\u2009g/d may be necessary to elicit significant effects.

      "abstract_tagged": "The high neuroactive potential of metabolites produced by gut microbes has gained traction over the last few years, with metagenomic-based studies suggesting an important role of <e3>@chemical$ microbiota-derived \u03b3-aminobutyric acid @/chemical$</e3> (<e4>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e4>) in modulating mental health. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of the <e5>@gene$ glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-encoding gene @/gene$</e5>, a key enzyme to produce <e6>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e6>, in the prominent <e7>@bacteria$ human intestinal genus <i>Bacteroides</i> @/bacteria$</e7>. Here, we investigated <e8>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e8> production by <i><e9>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e9></i> in culture and metabolic assays combined with <e10>@biomedical technique$ comparative genomics @/biomedical technique$</e10> and <e11>@biomedical technique$ phylogenetics @/biomedical technique$</e11>. A total of 961 <i><e12>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e12></i> genomes were analyzed <i>in silico</i> and 17 metabolically and genetically diverse human intestinal isolates representing 11 species were screened <i>in vitro</i>. Using the model organism <<e13>@bacteria$ i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> DSM 2079 @/bacteria$</e13>, we determined GABA production kinetics, its impact on milieu pH, and we assessed its role in mitigating <e14>@DDF$ acid-induced cellular damage @/DDF$</e14>. We showed that the GAD-system consists of at least four highly conserved genes encoding a <e15>@chemical$ GAD @/chemical$</e15>, a <e16>@chemical$ glutaminase @/chemical$</e16>, a <e17>@chemical$ glutamate/GABA antiporter @/chemical$</e17>, and a potassium channel. We demonstrated a high prevalence of the GAD-system among <i><e18>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e18></i> with 90% of all <i><e19>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e19></i> genomes (96% in <e20>@anatomical location$ human gut @/anatomical location$</e20> isolates only) harboring all genes of the GAD-system and 16 <e21>@bacteria$ intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> @/bacteria$</e21> strains producing <e22>@chemical$ GABA @/chemical$</e22> <i>in vitro</i> (ranging from 0.09 to 60.84 mM). We identified <e23>@chemical$ glutamate @/chemical$</e23> and <e24>@chemical$ glutamine @/chemical$</e24> as precursors of GABA production, showed that the production is regulated by pH, and that the GAD-system acts as a protective mechanism against <e25>@DDF$ acid stress @/DDF$</e25> in <i><e26>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e26></i>, mitigating cell death and preserving metabolic activity. Our data also indicate that the GAD-system might represent the only amino acid-dependent acid tolerance system in <i><e27>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e27></i>. Altogether, our results suggest an important contribution of <i><e28>@bacteria$ Bacteroides @/bacteria$</e28></i> in the regulation of the GABAergic system in the <e29>@anatomical location$ human gut @/anatomical location$</e29>."

Epidemiological, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that <e4>@DDF$ maternal obesity @/DDF$</e4>, <e5>@DDF$ overnutrition @/DDF$</e5> and unhealthy dietary patterns programs have lasting adverse effects on the physical and mental health of <e6>@human$ offspring @/human$</e6>. We review currently available preclinical and clinical evidence and summarise possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which <e7>@DDF$ maternal overnutrition @/DDF$</e7> may perturb offspring cognitive function, affective state and psychosocial behaviour, with a focus on (1) <e8>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e8>; (2) <e9>@DDF$ disrupted neuronal circuities and connectivity @/DDF$</e9>; and (3) <e10>@DDF$ dysregulated brain hormones @/DDF$</e10>. We briefly summarise research implicating the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> in maternal <e12>@DDF$ obesity-induced changes @/DDF$</e12> to offspring behaviour. In animal models, maternal obesogenic diet consumption disrupts CNS homeostasis in <e13>@human$ offspring @/human$</e13>, which is critical for healthy neurodevelopment, by altering hypothalamic and hippocampal development and recruitment of glial cells, which subsequently dysregulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The adverse effects of maternal obesogenic diets are also conferred through changes to hormones including <e14>@chemical$ leptin @/chemical$</e14>, <e15>@chemical$ insulin @/chemical$</e15> and <e16>@chemical$ oxytocin @/chemical$</e16> which interact with these brain regions and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the <e17>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e17> may directly and indirectly contribute to these maternal diet effects in both human and animal studies. As the specific pathways shaping <e18>@DDF$ abnormal behaviour @/DDF$</e18> in <e19>@human$ offspring @/human$</e19> in the context of maternal obesogenic diet exposure remain unknown, further investigations are needed to address this knowledge gap. Use of animal models permits investigation of changes in <e20>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e20>, neurotransmitter activity and hormones across global brain network and sex differences, which could be directly and indirectly modulated by the <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e21>."

In the context of the so-called microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, it is shown to have a strong influence on host neuromodulation and endocrine functions (i.e., controlling the synthesis of neurotransmitters like <e8>@chemical$ serotonin @/chemical$</e8> or mediating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), as well as in modulation of host immune responses, critically regulating <e9>@DDF$ intestinal, systemic and brain inflammation @/DDF$</e9> (<e10>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e10>).

Diet is one of the major factors involved in shaping the gut microbiota composition across the lifespan. However, whether and how diet can affect the <e2>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e2> via its effects on the microbiota is only now beginning to receive attention. Several mechanisms for gut-to-brain communication have been identified, including <e3>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e3>, immune, neuronal, and metabolic pathways, some of which could be prone to dietary modulation. Animal studies investigating the potential of nutritional interventions on the microbiota-gut-brain axis have led to advancements in our understanding of the role of diet in this bidirectional communication. In this review, we summarize the current state of the literature triangulating diet, microbiota, and host behavior/brain processes and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. Additionally, determinants of the responsiveness to a dietary intervention and evidence for the microbiota as an underlying modulator of the effect of diet on brain health are outlined. In particular, we emphasize the understudied use of whole-dietary approaches in this endeavor and the need for greater evidence from <e4>@human$ clinical populations @/human$</e4>. While promising results are reported, additional data, specifically from <e5>@statistical technique$ clinical cohorts @/statistical technique$</e5>, are required to provide evidence-based recommendations for the development of microbiota-targeted, whole-dietary strategies to improve brain and mental health."

      "abstract_tagged": "Executive function (EF) consists of explicit emotion regulation (EER) and cognitive control (CC). Childhood EER in particular predicts mental and physical health in adulthood. Identifying factors affecting EER development has implications for lifelong physical and mental health. <e4>@microbiome$ Gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e4> (<e5>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e5>) has attracted attention as a potential biomarker for risk of <e6>@DDF$ physical and mental problems @/DDF$</e6> in adulthood. Furthermore, <e7>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e7> is related to brain function/structure, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. However, little is known about how GM compositions are associated with the development of emotion regulation in early childhood. Therefore, in this study, we examined 257 <e8>@human$ children aged 3-4 @/human$</e8> to investigate links between <e9>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e9> and risk to EF. EF was measured using the Mother-Reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version.

Our results show that <e12>@human$ children with EER-risk @/human$</e12> (an index of inhibitory self-control) had a higher abundance of the genera <i><e13>@bacteria$ Actinomyces @/bacteria$</e13></i> and <i><e14>@bacteria$ Sutterella @/bacteria$</e14></i>. Although we have not established a direct link between <e15>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e15> and CC risk, our findings indicate that <e16>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e16> of <e17>@human$ preschoolers @/human$</e17> is closely associated with emotional processing and that <e18>@human$ EERrisk children @/human$</e18> have more <e19>@bacteria$ inflammation-related bacteria @/bacteria$</e19>."

Moreover, the microbial composition was significantly different between the two groups, involving five phyla and 38 genera (p<0.05). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the metabolic-related parameters and abundance of altered microbiota including <e30>@chemical$ HDL-c @/chemical$</e30> (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.203, p=0.0005), <e31>@chemical$ GLU @/chemical$</e31> (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.286, p=0.0005) and WC (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.061, p=0.037). Furthermore, <e32>@biomedical technique$ KEGG pathway analysis @/biomedical technique$</e32> showed that 16 signaling pathways were significantly enriched between the two groups (p<0.05).

In our opinion, KD should be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic option for some <e15>@DDF$ neurological diseases @/DDF$</e15>."

Microglia, first described a century ago, are the main neuroimmune cells and have three essential functions: a sentinel function involved in constant sensing of changes in their environment, a housekeeping function that promotes neuronal well-being and normal operation, and a defense function necessary for responding to such changes and providing neuroprotection. Microglia use a defined armamentarium of genes to perform these tasks. In response to specific stimuli, or with <e2>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e2>, microglia also have the capacity to damage and kill neurons. <e3>@DDF$ Injury to neurons @/DDF$</e3> in <e4>@DDF$ Alzheimer's @/DDF$</e4>, <e5>@DDF$ Parkinson's @/DDF$</e5>, <e6>@DDF$ Huntington's @/DDF$</e6>, and prion diseases, as well as in <e7>@DDF$ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis @/DDF$</e7>, <e8>@DDF$ frontotemporal dementia @/DDF$</e8>, and <e9>@DDF$ chronic traumatic encephalopathy @/DDF$</e9>, results from <e10>@DDF$ disruption of the sentinel or housekeeping functions @/DDF$</e10> and <e11>@DDF$ dysregulation of the defense function @/DDF$</e11> and <e12>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e12>. Pathways associated with such injury include several sensing and housekeeping pathways, such as the <e13>@gene$ Trem2 @/gene$</e13>, <e14>@gene$ Cx3cr1 @/gene$</e14> and progranulin pathways, which act as immune checkpoints to keep the <e15>@DDF$ microglial inflammatory response @/DDF$</e15> under control, and the scavenger receptor pathways, which promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Peripheral interference from <e16>@DDF$ systemic inflammation @/DDF$</e16> or the <e17>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e17> can also alter progression of such injury. Initiation or exacerbation of <e18>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e18> results from an imbalance between these microglial functions; correcting such imbalance may be a potential mode for therapy."

      "abstract_tagged": "The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the <e3>@chemical$ N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor @/chemical$</e3> (<e4>@chemical$ NMDAR @/chemical$</e4>) antagonist <e5>@drug$ (R,S)-ketamine @/drug$</e5> has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. <e6>@drug$ (R,S)-ketamine @/drug$</e6> is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of <e7>@drug$ (R)-ketamine @/drug$</e7> (<e8>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e8>) and <e9>@drug$ (S)-ketamine @/drug$</e9> (<e10>@drug$ esketamine @/drug$</e10>). In 2019, an <e11>@drug$ esketamine @/drug$</e11> nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for <e12>@DDF$ treatment-resistant depression @/DDF$</e12>. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that <e13>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e13> has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than <e14>@drug$ esketamine @/drug$</e14> in <e15>@animal$ rodents @/animal$</e15>, despite the lower binding affinity of <e16>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e16> for the <e17>@chemical$ NMDAR @/chemical$</e17>. In clinical trials, <e18>@chemical$ non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds @/chemical$</e18> did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in <e19>@human$ patients @/human$</e19> with <e20>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e20>, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in <e21>@animal$ rodents @/animal$</e21>. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to <e22>@human$ humans @/human$</e22> due to the complexity of <e23>@DDF$ human psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e23>. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that <e24>@chemical$ NMDAR @/chemical$</e24> plays a major role in the antidepressant action of <e25>@drug$ (R,S)-ketamine @/drug$</e25> and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of <e26>@drug$ (R,S)-ketamine @/drug$</e26> and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of <e27>@drug$ (R,S)-ketamine @/drug$</e27> and its potent enantiomer <e28>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e28>. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in <e29>@DDF$ stress-related psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e29> and in the antidepressant-like action of <e30>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e30>. Finally, we discuss the potential of <e31>@drug$ arketamine @/drug$</e31> as a treatment for <e32>@DDF$ cognitive impairment @/DDF$</e32> in <e33>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e33>, <e34>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e34>, <e35>@DDF$ osteoporosis @/DDF$</e35>, <e36>@DDF$ inflammatory bowel diseases @/DDF$</e36>, and <e37>@DDF$ stroke @/DDF$</e37>."

The <e9>@anatomical location$ subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e9> serves as a major modulatory pathway between the <e10>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e10> and <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11>. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the depression-like phenotype and the abnormal composition of <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> in <e13>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e13> after <e14>@chemical$ lipopolysaccharide @/chemical$</e14> (<e15>@chemical$ LPS @/chemical$</e15>) administration. <e16>@chemical$ LPS @/chemical$</e16> caused a depression-like phenotype, <e17>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e17>, increase in spleen weight, and downregulation of <e18>@chemical$ synaptic proteins @/chemical$</e18> in the <e19>@anatomical location$ medial prefrontal cortex @/anatomical location$</e19> (<e20>@anatomical location$ mPFC @/anatomical location$</e20>) in the <e21>@animal$ sham-operated mice @/animal$</e21>.

The spleen weight and plasma levels of <e25>@chemical$ pro-inflammatory cytokines @/chemical$</e25> in the SDV\u2009+\u2009LPS group were lower than those of the sham\u2009+\u2009LPS group. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between the plasma levels of <e26>@chemical$ pro-inflammatory cytokines @/chemical$</e26> and spleen weight, suggesting a relationship between inflammatory events and spleen weight. Furthermore, <e27>@chemical$ LPS @/chemical$</e27> led to significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity in <e28>@animal$ sham-operated mice @/animal$</e28>, but not <e29>@animal$ SDV-operated mice @/animal$</e29>. In an <e30>@biomedical technique$ unweighted UniFrac PCoA @/biomedical technique$</e30>, the dots representing the sham\u2009+\u2009LPS group were located far away from the dots representing the other three groups. Our results suggest that <e31>@chemical$ LPS @/chemical$</e31> produces a depression-like phenotype, increases spleen weight, triggers <e32>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e32>, downregulates <e33>@chemical$ synaptic proteins @/chemical$</e33> in the <e34>@anatomical location$ mPFC @/anatomical location$</e34>, and leads to abnormal composition of <e35>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e35> via the <e36>@anatomical location$ subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e36>.

Increasing evidence, particularly that from clinical studies on <e9>@human$ ASD patients @/human$</e9>, suggests a functional link between the <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e10> and the development of <e11>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e11>. However, the mechanisms linking the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> with <e13>@DDF$ brain dysfunctions @/DDF$</e13> (gut-brain axis) in <e14>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e14> have not yet been full elucidated. Due to its genetic mutations and downregulated expression in <e15>@human$ patients @/human$</e15> with <e16>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e16>, <e17>@gene$ EPHB6 @/gene$</e17>, which also plays important roles in gut homeostasis, is generally considered a candidate gene for <e18>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e18>. Nonetheless, the role and mechanism of <e19>@gene$ EPHB6 @/gene$</e19> in regulating the <e20>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e20> and the development of <e21>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e21> are unclear. Here, we found that the deletion of <e22>@gene$ EphB6 @/gene$</e22> induced <e23>@DDF$ autism-like behavior @/DDF$</e23> and disturbed the <e24>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e24> in <e25>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e25>. More importantly, transplantation of the <e26>@microbiome$ fecal microbiota @/microbiome$</e26> from <e27>@animal$ EphB6-deficient mice @/animal$</e27> resulted in <e28>@DDF$ autism-like behavior @/DDF$</e28> in antibiotic-treated <e29>@animal$ C57BL/6J mice @/animal$</e29>, and transplantation of the <e30>@microbiome$ fecal microbiota @/microbiome$</e30> from <e31>@animal$ wild-type mice @/animal$</e31> ameliorated the <e32>@DDF$ autism-like behavior @/DDF$</e32> in <e33>@animal$ EphB6-deficient mice @/animal$</e33>. At the metabolic level, the disturbed <e34>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e34> in <e35>@animal$ EphB6-deficient mice @/animal$</e35> led to <e36>@chemical$ vitamin B<sub>6</sub> @/chemical$</e36> and <e37>@chemical$ dopamine @/chemical$</e37> defects.

The multifactorial nature of <e7>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e7> poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression.

There are no effective tools to prevent <e9>@DDF$ PD onset @/DDF$</e9>, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10>. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of <e11>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e11> have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established. Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the <e12>@microbiome$ host gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e12> seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of <e13>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e13>, thus are considered potential biomarkers.

Evidence suggests that varying levels of <e14>@DDF$ neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e14> might underlie these states in <e15>@human$ IBD patients @/human$</e15>. Within this context, microglia are the crucial non-neural cells in the <e16>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e16> responsible for innate immune responses following <e17>@DDF$ inflammatory insults @/DDF$</e17>. Alterations in microglia's functions, such as secretory profile, phagocytic activity, and synaptic pruning, might play significant roles in mediating <e18>@DDF$ psychiatric manifestations of IBD @/DDF$</e18>. In this review, we discuss the role played by microglia in <e19>@DDF$ IBD-associated comorbidities @/DDF$</e19>."

      "abstract_tagged": "The <e2>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e2> and its related <e3>@DDF$ CNS pathologies @/DDF$</e3> need an urgent toolbox to minimize the global mental health burden. The neuroimmune system critically regulates the brain maturation and survival of neurons across the nervous system. The chronic manipulated immunological drive can accelerate the neuronal pathology hence promoting the burden of <e4>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e4>. The <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> is home for trillions of microorganisms having a mutual relationship with the host system. The gut-brain axis is a unique biochemical pathway through which the gut residing microbes connects with the brain cells and regulates various physiological and pathological cascades. The <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> and CNS communicate using a common language that synchronizes the tuning of immune cells. The <e7>@microbiome$ intestinal gut microbial community @/microbiome$</e7> has a profound role in the maturation of the immune system as well as the development of the nervous system. We have critically summarised the clinical and preclinical reports from the past a decade emphasising that the significant changes in <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> can enhance the host susceptibility towards <e9>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e9>. In this review, we\u00a0have discussed how the gut microbiota-mediated immune response inclines the host physiology towards <e10>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e10> and indicated the <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> as a potential future candidate for the management of <e12>@DDF$ neurodegenerative disorders @/DDF$</e12>."

The potential gut-to-brain pathway is poorly understood in <e18>@human$ patients @/human$</e18> receiving chemotherapy. Our prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between chemotherapy treatment, gut changes, <e19>@DDF$ peripheral and central inflammation @/DDF$</e19>, and behavioral symptoms in <e20>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e20>.

In cohabitation studies, presumed <e29>@DDF$ coprophagia @/DDF$</e29> promoted body mass recovery, however strong associations with <e30>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e30> and behavior were not observed. Reduction of gut microbial alpha diversity via <e31>@drug$ antibiotics @/drug$</e31> did not prevent chemotherapy-associated side effects, however the relative abundances of the genera <e32>@bacteria$ Tyzzerella @/bacteria$</e32>, <e33>@bacteria$ Romboutsia @/bacteria$</e33>, and <e34>@bacteria$ Turicibacter @/bacteria$</e34> correlated with circulating inflammatory (<e35>@chemical$ IL-1\u03b2 @/chemical$</e35>) and behavioral outcomes (<e36>@DDF$ lethargy @/DDF$</e36>, <e37>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e37>).

      "abstract_tagged": "Changes in the gut microenvironment may influence the pathogenesis of <e3>@DDF$ autism spectrum disorders @/DDF$</e3> (<e4>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e4>). Here, we investigated the composition of the <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e5> and metabolites in <e6>@human$ children @/human$</e6> with <e7>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e7>. Ninety-two <e8>@human$ children @/human$</e8> with <e9>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e9> and 42 <e10>@human$ age-matched children @/human$</e10> exhibiting <e11>@DDF$ typical development @/DDF$</e11> (<e12>@DDF$ TD @/DDF$</e12>) were enrolled in the two-stage study. In the discovery stage, <e13>@biomedical technique$ shotgun metagenomic sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13> and <e14>@biomedical technique$ liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry @/biomedical technique$</e14> (<e15>@biomedical technique$ LC-MS @/biomedical technique$</e15>) were performed simultaneously on fecal samples obtained from 43 <e16>@human$ children @/human$</e16> in the <e17>@human$ ASD group @/human$</e17> and 31 <e18>@human$ children @/human$</e18> in the <e19>@human$ TD group @/human$</e19>. Systematic <e20>@biomedical technique$ bioinformatic analyses @/biomedical technique$</e20> were performed to identify <e21>@chemical$ gut metabolites @/chemical$</e21> associated with altered gut microbiota composition. At the validation stage, differential metabolites were tested using <e22>@biomedical technique$ LC-MS @/biomedical technique$</e22> with an additional 49 and 11 <e23>@human$ children @/human$</e23> in the <e24>@human$ ASD and TD groups @/human$</e24>, respectively. Altered <e25>@chemical$ glutamate metabolites @/chemical$</e25> were found in the <e26>@human$ ASD group @/human$</e26>, along with a decline in <e27>@chemical$ 2-keto-glutaramic acid @/chemical$</e27> and an abundance of microbiota associated with glutamate metabolism. These changes in glutamate metabolism were correlated with lower levels of the highly abundant bacteria <e28>@bacteria$ Bacteroides vulgatus @/bacteria$</e28> and higher levels of the potentially harmful <e29>@bacteria$ Eggerthella lenta @/bacteria$</e29> and <e30>@bacteria$ Clostridium botulinum @/bacteria$</e30>. Lower gut cortisol levels have also been identified in the <e31>@human$ ASD group @/human$</e31> and associated with changes in gut microbiota glutamate metabolism. Finally, <e32>@chemical$ gut 2-keto-glutaramic acid @/chemical$</e32> was validated as a potential biomarker for <e33>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e33>. The significant changes in the gut microenvironment in <e34>@human$ children @/human$</e34> with <e35>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e35> may provide new insight into the cause of <e36>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e36> and aid in the search for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the <e37>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e37> may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <e38>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e38>, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. Through a comprehensive <e39>@biomedical technique$ gut metagenomic and metabolome study @/biomedical technique$</e39> of <e40>@human$ children @/human$</e40> with <e41>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e41>, alterations in gut metabolite composition were found in <e42>@human$ children @/human$</e42> with <e43>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e43>, and these alterations were linked to changes in gut microbiota composition. This may give us a deeper understanding of the role of <e44>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e44> in the pathogenesis of <e45>@DDF$ ASD @/DDF$</e45>."

Our primary aim for this analysis tests the hypothesis that those with poor overall diet quality at baseline benefit more. The second aim is to explore whether specific components of diet quality moderate treatment response. 124 <e8>@human$ children @/human$</e8> (69 <e9>@dietary supplement$ multinutrients @/dietary supplement$</e9>, 55 <e10>@drug$ placebo @/drug$</e10>) had diet quality assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015). For each potential moderator, the outcome CGI-I at week 8 (RCT-end), was modeled two ways: (1) as a dichotomous variable: responder/non-responder, with responders defined by a rating of 1 or 2 'very much' or 'much improved,' all else equals non-responder using <e11>@statistical technique$ logistic regression @/statistical technique$</e11>, and (2) as a dimensional improvement outcome from 1\u2009=\u2009very much improved to 7\u2009=\u2009very much worse, using <e12>@statistical technique$ linear regression @/statistical technique$</e12>. HEI-2015 total score did not moderate treatment response [odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.00 (95% CI: 0.90,1.10), <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.984] or improvement [\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.01 (95% CI: -0.06,0.04), <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.648]. However, total vegetable intake moderated level of improvement in exploratory analysis [\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.48 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.13), <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.007]: those with higher baseline vegetable intake showed greater benefit from <e13>@dietary supplement$ multinutrients @/dietary supplement$</e13> compared to placebo. <e14>@dietary supplement$ Multinutrients @/dietary supplement$</e14> may benefit <e15>@human$ children @/human$</e15> with <e16>@DDF$ ADHD @/DDF$</e16> and <e17>@DDF$ irritability @/DDF$</e17> regardless of overall diet quality. The finding that higher baseline vegetable intake may improve response to <e18>@dietary supplement$ multinutrients @/dietary supplement$</e18> deserves further exploration, including dietary effect on gut microbiota and absorption of multinutrients and parental factors."

In this publication, we describe exposures, health conditions, and medication use of <e12>@human$ Veterans @/human$</e12> in the US Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) and examine the associations between these characteristics and the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13>. This cohort included 331 <e14>@human$ US Veterans @/human$</e14> seeking healthcare with the Veterans Health Administration who were 83% <e15>@human$ male @/human$</e15> with an average (\u00b1SD) age of 47.6\u00a0\u200b\u00b1\u00a0\u200b13.4 years. The cohort displayed a high prevalence of <e16>@DDF$ PTSD @/DDF$</e16> (49.8%) and history of <e17>@DDF$ traumatic brain injuries @/DDF$</e17> (76.1%), and high current use of <e18>@drug$ prescription medications @/drug$</e18> (74.9%) to treat various acute and chronic conditions.

Many of the Veteran characteristics examined were associated with altered relative abundances of specific taxa. We found that <e29>@DDF$ PVD @/DDF$</e29> and <e30>@DDF$ cardiovascular disease @/DDF$</e30> were associated with lower microbiota diversity in the <e31>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e31> (i.e., \u03b1-diversity), while <e32>@dietary supplement$ supplemental vitamin use @/dietary supplement$</e32> was associated with higher \u03b1-diversity. Our study contributes novel insights as to whether the unique exposures of <e33>@human$ Veterans @/human$</e33> in this cohort correlate with gut microbiota characteristics and, in line with previous findings with other population-level studies of the microbiome, confirms associations between numerous health conditions and medications with the <e34>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e34>."

We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords <e12>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e12>, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships. Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to <e13>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e13>. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics. Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and <e14>@DDF$ psychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e14>. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, <e15>@DDF$ psychological stress @/DDF$</e15> or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic. These epigenetic modifications are also correlated with <e16>@DDF$ neurophysiological, inflammatory or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulations @/DDF$</e16>."

      "abstract_tagged": "<e2>@DDF$ Bipolar disorder @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e3>) is a common <e4>@DDF$ psychiatric illness @/DDF$</e4> with high prevalence and disease burden. Accumulating susceptibility genes for <e5>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e5> have been identified in recent years. However, the exact functions of these genes remain largely unknown. Despite its high heritability, gene and environment interaction is commonly accepted as the major contributing factor to <e6>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e6> pathogenesis. <e7>@microbiome$ Intestine microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> is increasingly recognized as a critical environmental factor for human health and diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <e8>@human$ BD individuals @/human$</e8> showed altered diversity and compositions in the <e9>@microbiome$ commensal microbiota @/microbiome$</e9>. In addition to pro-inflammatory factors, such as <e10>@chemical$ interleukin-6 @/chemical$</e10> and <e11>@chemical$ tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 @/chemical$</e11>, type 1 interferon signalling pathway is also modulated by specific intestinal bacterial strains. Disruption of the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to <e12>@DDF$ peripheral and central nervous system inflammation @/DDF$</e12>, which accounts for the BD aetiology.

In this review, we focus on the influence of <e16>@microbiome$ intestine microbiota @/microbiome$</e16> on the expression of <e17>@gene$ bipolar gene TRANK1 @/gene$</e17> and propose that intestine microbiota-dependent type 1 interferon signalling is sufficient to induce the over-expression of <e18>@gene$ TRANK1 @/gene$</e18>, consequently causing the compromise of BBB integrity and facilitating the entrance of inflammatory mediators into the <e19>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e19>. <e20>@DDF$ Activated neuroinflammation @/DDF$</e20> eventually contributes to the occurrence and development of <e21>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e21>. This review provides a new perspective on how <e22>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e22> participate in the pathogenesis of <e23>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e23>. Future studies are needed to validate these assumptions and develop new treatment targets for <e24>@DDF$ BD @/DDF$</e24>."

      "abstract_tagged": "In recent years, attention has been focused on the benefit of greenspace on mental health, and it is suggested this link may vary with the type of greenspace. More and more studies have emphasized the influence of the <e3>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e3> on <e4>@DDF$ schizophrenia @/DDF$</e4> (<e5>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e5>). However, the effects of greenspaces on the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6> in <e7>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e7> and the effect of different types of greenspaces on the <e8>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> remain unclear. We aim to examine if there were variations in the effects of various greenspace types on the <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e9> in <e10>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e10>. Besides, we sink to explore important taxonomic compositions associated with different greenspace types. We recruited 243 objects with <e11>@DDF$ schizophrenia @/DDF$</e11> from Anhui Mental Health Center and collected fecal samples for <e12>@biomedical technique$ 16Sr RNA gene sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e12>. Three types of greenery coverage were calculated with different circular buffers (800, 1500, and 3000\u00a0m) corresponding to individual addresses. The association between greenspace and microbiome composition was analyzed with <e13>@statistical technique$ permutational analysis of variance @/statistical technique$</e13> (<e14>@statistical technique$ PERMANOVA @/statistical technique$</e14>). We conducted the <e15>@statistical technique$ linear regression @/statistical technique$</e15> to capture specific <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e16> taxa associated with greenery coverage. Tree coverage was consistently associated with microbial composition in both 1500\u00a0m (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.007, P\u2009=\u20090.030) and 3000\u00a0m (R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.007, P\u2009=\u20090.039). In contrast, there was no association with grass cover in any of the buffer zones. In the <e17>@statistical technique$ regression analysis @/statistical technique$</e17>, higher tree coverage was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of several taxa. Among them, tree coverage was positively associated with increased <e18>@bacteria$ Bifidobacterium longum @/bacteria$</e18> (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.069, P\u2009=\u20090.004), which was the dominant composition in the <e19>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e19>. The relationship between greenspace and <e20>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e20> in <e21>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e21> differed by the type of greenspace. Besides, \"tree coverage\" may present a dominant effect on the important taxonomic composition. Our findings might provide instructive evidence for the design of urban greenspace to optimize health and well-being in <e22>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e22> as well as the whole people."

Of particular interest is the gut/microbiome-liver-brain axis for parsing out how genetic and environmental factors contribute to <e7>@DDF$ NDs @/DDF$</e7>. We have developed a mesofluidic platform technology to study gut-liver-cerebral interactions in the context of <e8>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e8> (<e9>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e9>). It connects microphysiological systems (MPSs) of the <e10>@anatomical location$ primary human gut @/anatomical location$</e10> and <e11>@anatomical location$ liver @/anatomical location$</e11> with a <e12>@biomedical technique$ human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral MPS @/biomedical technique$</e12> in a systemically circulated common culture medium containing <e13>@chemical$ CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T @/chemical$</e13> and <e14>@chemical$ T helper 17 @/chemical$</e14> cells. We demonstrate this approach using a patient-derived cerebral MPS carrying the <e15>@gene$ PD-causing A53T mutation @/gene$</e15>, gaining two important findings: (i) that systemic interaction enhances features of in vivo-like behavior of cerebral MPSs, and (ii) that <e16>@chemical$ microbiome-associated short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e16> increase expression of pathology-associated pathways in <e17>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e17>."

Further research into the link between dietary fiber intake and <e23>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e23> and <e24>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e24> is essential, as findings could potentially provide guidance for improvement in or prevention of <e25>@DDF$ inflammatory and depressive disorders @/DDF$</e25>."

In <e11>@DDF$ multiple sclerosis @/DDF$</e11> and other autoimmune conditions, several studies have been done, or are in progress, to find correlations between intestinal permeability, <e12>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e12>, MAIT cell responses, and clinical biomarkers in <e13>@human$ treated and treatment-na\u00efve patients @/human$</e13>. The final aims are to explain what activates MAIT cells in diseases not primarily infective, which interactions with the microbiota are potentially pathogenic, and their dynamics related to disease course and disease-modifying treatments."

We applied a <e8>@biomedical technique$ targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method @/biomedical technique$</e8> to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the <e9>@human$ non-depressed general population @/human$</e9> (<e10>@human$ GP @/human$</e10>) (n\u00a0=\u00a0247) and a cohort of <e11>@human$ individuals @/human$</e11> with <e12>@DDF$ major depressive disorder @/DDF$</e12> (<e13>@DDF$ MDD @/DDF$</e13>) (n\u00a0=\u00a099). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of <e14>@chemical$ hippuric acid @/chemical$</e14> in the <e15>@human$ GP cohort @/human$</e15>. In the <e16>@human$ GP cohort @/human$</e16>, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the <e17>@human$ MDD cohort @/human$</e17>, but in these <e18>@human$ individuals @/human$</e18> it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of <e19>@chemical$ hippuric acid @/chemical$</e19> suggest that already-moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and <e20>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e20>."

Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, <e7>@biomedical technique$ biotics @/biomedical technique$</e7>, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the <e8>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e8> in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the <e9>@statistical technique$ meta-analysis @/statistical technique$</e9> showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD,\u2009-\u20090.57; 95% CI\u2009-\u20090.93 to\u2009-\u20090.21; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200942%; P\u2009=\u20090.002) with a qualitative trend of improvement in <e10>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e10>. However, current studies have high methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes, requiring more well-designed and controlled studies to elucidate the complex linkage between microbiome, microbiome-modulating interventions, and <e11>@DDF$ NDDs @/DDF$</e11>."

Accordingly, sixteen human case-control studies have published gut microbiome composition changes in <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8> and reported over 100 differentially abundant taxa covering all taxonomic levels from phylum to genus or species, depending on methodology. While certain findings were replicated across several studies, various contradictory findings were reported. Here, differences in methodologies and the presence of possible confounders in the <e9>@human$ study populations @/human$</e9> are assessed for their potential to confound the results of gut microbiome studies in <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10>.

To move from the current heterogeneous dataset towards clinically relevant biomarkers and the identification of putative therapeutic targets, recommendations are derived from the limitations of the available studies to increase the future comparability of microbiome studies in <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15>. In addition, integration of currently available data on the <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e16> in <e17>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e17> is proposed to identify robust gut microbiome profiles in <e18>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e18>.

      "abstract_tagged": "<e3>@DDF$ Neurological disorders @/DDF$</e3>, including <e4>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e4>, have a significant negative impact on both <e5>@human$ patients @/human$</e5> and society at large. Since the prevalence of most of these disorders increases with age, the consequences for our <e6>@human$ aging population @/human$</e6> are only going to grow. It is now acknowledged that <e7>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e7> are multi-factorial involving <e8>@DDF$ disruptions in multiple cellular systems @/DDF$</e8>. While each disorder has specific initiating mechanisms and pathologies, certain common pathways appear to be involved in most, if not all, <e9>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e9>. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important to identify compounds that can modulate the multiple pathways that contribute to disease development or progression. One of these compounds is the <e10>@chemical$ flavonol fisetin @/chemical$</e10>. <e11>@chemical$ Fisetin @/chemical$</e11> has now been shown in preclinical models to be effective at preventing the development and/or progression of multiple <e12>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e12> including <e13>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e13>, <e14>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e14>, <e15>@DDF$ Huntington's disease @/DDF$</e15>, <e16>@DDF$ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis @/DDF$</e16>, <e17>@DDF$ stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) @/DDF$</e17> and <e18>@DDF$ traumatic brain injury @/DDF$</e18> as well as to reduce age-associated changes in the <e19>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e19>. These beneficial effects stem from its actions on multiple pathways associated with the different <e20>@DDF$ neurological disorders @/DDF$</e20>. These actions include its well characterized anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as more recently described effects on the regulated cell death oxytosis/ferroptosis pathway, the <e21>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e21> and its senolytic activity. Therefore, the growing body of pre-clinical data, along with fisetin's ability to modulate a large number of pathways associated with <e22>@DDF$ brain dysfunction @/DDF$</e22>, strongly suggest that it would be worthwhile to pursue its therapeutic effects in <e23>@human$ humans @/human$</e23>."

In <e12>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e12>, bacterial members of the <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> can influence the host gut-brain axis, affecting <e14>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e14> and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the <e15>@chemical$ stress hormone corticosterone @/chemical$</e15> (<e16>@chemical$ CORT @/chemical$</e16>). Here we showed that <e17>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e17> colonized with <e18>@bacteria$ C. albicans @/bacteria$</e18> demonstrated increased <e19>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e19> and increased basal production of <e20>@chemical$ CORT @/chemical$</e20> as well as <e21>@DDF$ dysregulation of CORT production @/DDF$</e21> following <e22>@DDF$ acute stress @/DDF$</e22>. The HPA axis and <e23>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e23> are negatively regulated by the <e24>@chemical$ endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide @/chemical$</e24> (<e25>@chemical$ AEA @/chemical$</e25>). We demonstrated that <e26>@animal$ C. albicans-colonized mice @/animal$</e26> exhibited changes in the <e27>@chemical$ endocannabinoidome @/chemical$</e27>. Further, increasing AEA levels using the well-characterized <e28>@chemical$ fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 @/chemical$</e28> was sufficient to reverse both neuroendocrine phenotypes in <e29>@animal$ C. albicans-colonized mice @/animal$</e29>. Thus, a commensal fungus that is a common colonizer of <e30>@human$ humans @/human$</e30> had widespread effects on the physiology of its host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial manipulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system that resulted in neuroendocrine changes contributing to <e31>@DDF$ anxiety-like behavior @/DDF$</e31>."

It has been postulated that gut pathogens and <e5>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e5> can contribute to <e6>@DDF$ peripheral inflammatory states @/DDF$</e6> or trigger downstream metabolic effects that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in <e7>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e7>. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated disrupted intestinal permeability, <e8>@DDF$ intestinal inflammation @/DDF$</e8>, altered <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e9>, and reduced <e10>@chemical$ fecal short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e10> in <e11>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e11>. In this regard, microbial-directed therapies such as <e12>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e12> are emerging as potential therapeutic options. <e13>@dietary supplement$ Probiotic supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e13> is postulated to confer a variety of health benefits due to the diverse functions of these live microorganisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization, modulation/\"normalization\" of the microbiome and/or its function, immunomodulatory effects (e.g. reducing <e14>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e14>), and improved host epithelial barrier function. Interestingly, several PD animal model studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of <e15>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e15> in reducing <e16>@DDF$ dopaminergic neuronal degeneration @/DDF$</e16>. Notably, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided class I evidence for <e17>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e17> as a treatment for <e18>@DDF$ constipation @/DDF$</e18> in <e19>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e19>. However, the effects of <e20>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e20> on other PD aspects, such as <e21>@DDF$ motor disability @/DDF$</e21> and cognitive function, and its long-term efficacy (including effects on PD drug absorption in the <e22>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e22>) have not been investigated adequately. Further targeted animal and human studies are also warranted to understand the mechanisms of actions of <e23>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e23> in <e24>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e24> and to tailor <e25>@dietary supplement$ probiotic therapy @/dietary supplement$</e25> based on individual host profiles to improve patient outcomes in this disabling disorder."

It results from an <e7>@DDF$ extremely severe impairment of propulsive motility @/DDF$</e7>. The intestinal endocrine system (IES) jointly with the enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates secreto-motor functions via <e8>@chemical$ different hormones @/chemical$</e8> and <e9>@chemical$ bioactive messengers/neurotransmitters @/chemical$</e9>. The <e10>@chemical$ neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine @/chemical$</e10> (<e11>@chemical$ 5-HT @/chemical$</e11>) (or <e12>@chemical$ serotonin @/chemical$</e12>) is linked to intestinal peristalsis and secretory reflexes. <e13>@microbiome$ Gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> and its interplay with ENS affect 5-HT synthesis, release, and the subsequent serotonin receptor activation. To date, the interplay between <e14>@chemical$ 5-HT @/chemical$</e14> and <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e15> in <e16>@DDF$ PIPO @/DDF$</e16> remains largely unclear.

To this purpose, biopsies of the <e20>@anatomical location$ colon @/anatomical location$</e20>, <e21>@anatomical location$ ileum @/anatomical location$</e21> and <e22>@anatomical location$ duodenum @/anatomical location$</e22> have been collected from 7 <e23>@human$ PIPO patients @/human$</e23>, and 7 <e24>@human$ age-/sex-matched healthy controls @/human$</e24>. After <e25>@biomedical technique$ DNA extraction @/biomedical technique$</e25>, the <e26>@microbiome$ MAM @/microbiome$</e26> was assessed by <e27>@biomedical technique$ next generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial RNA 16\u00a0S @/biomedical technique$</e27>, on an Illumina Miseq platform. The expression of genes implicated in serotoninergic pathway (<e28>@gene$ TPH1 @/gene$</e28>, <e29>@gene$ SLC6A4 @/gene$</e29>, <e30>@gene$ 5-HTR3 @/gene$</e30> and <e31>@gene$ 5-HTR4 @/gene$</e31>) was established by <e32>@biomedical technique$ qPCR @/biomedical technique$</e32>, and correlations with <e33>@microbiome$ MAM @/microbiome$</e33> and clinical parameters of <e34>@DDF$ PIPO @/DDF$</e34> have been evaluated. Our results revealed that <e35>@human$ PIPO patients @/human$</e35> exhibit a <e36>@microbiome$ MAM @/microbiome$</e36> with a different composition and with <e37>@DDF$ dysbiosis @/DDF$</e37>, i.e. with a lower biodiversity and fewer less connected species with a greater number of non-synergistic relationships, compared to <e38>@human$ controls @/human$</e38>. <e39>@biomedical technique$ qPCR @/biomedical technique$</e39> results revealed modifications in the expression of <e40>@gene$ serotonin-related intestinal genes @/gene$</e40> in <e41>@human$ PIPO patients @/human$</e41>, when compared to <e42>@human$ controls @/human$</e42>. <e43>@statistical technique$ Correlation analysis @/statistical technique$</e43> do not reveal any kind of connection. For the first time, we report in <e44>@human$ PIPO patients @/human$</e44> a <e45>@microbiome$ specific MAM associated to underlying pathology @/microbiome$</e45> and an <e46>@DDF$ altered intestinal serotonin pathway @/DDF$</e46>. A possible <e47>@DDF$ dysfunction of the serotonin pathway, possibly related to or triggered by an altered microbiota @/DDF$</e47>, may contribute to <e48>@DDF$ dysmotility @/DDF$</e48> in <e49>@human$ PIPO patients @/human$</e49>.

To date, there are treatments that can help relieve Parkinson' disease (PD)-associated symptoms, but there is no cure to control the onset and progression of this disorder. Altered components of the <e5>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e5> could represent a key role in gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting gut-brain axis function. <e6>@microbiome$ Gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e6> restoration through selected probiotics' administration has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of the novel formulation <e7>@dietary supplement$ SLAB51 @/dietary supplement$</e7> in <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8>.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), instructed by pattern differentiation, is effective in treating <e8>@DDF$ IBS-D @/DDF$</e8>, in which <e9>@DDF$ liver depression and spleen deficiency @/DDF$</e9> (<e10>@DDF$ LDSD @/DDF$</e10>) is the most prevalent pattern. Still, it is unclear the linkage between the LDSD pattern and the BA metabolic phenotype. This study aimed to uncover the biological basis of the LDSD pattern from the BA metabolic perspective. <e11>@human$ Patients @/human$</e11> with <e12>@DDF$ IBS-D @/DDF$</e12> completed questionnaires regarding the irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), stool frequency, Stool Bristol scale, and Self-Rating Scales of mental health. Fasting blood and morning feces were collected to analyze the gut metagenome and BA-related indices/metabolites. <e13>@human$ IBS-D patients @/human$</e13> with <e14>@DDF$ LDSD @/DDF$</e14> had a higher incidence of BA overexcretion (41% vs. 23% non-LDSD) with significant elevations in fecal total BAs and <e15>@chemical$ serum BA precursor 7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one @/chemical$</e15> levels. Compared to <e16>@human$ controls @/human$</e16> or <e17>@human$ non-LDSD patients @/human$</e17>, <e18>@human$ LDSD patients @/human$</e18> had a featured fecal BA profile, with higher proportions of <e19>@chemical$ deoxycholic acid @/chemical$</e19> (<e20>@chemical$ DCA @/chemical$</e20>), <e21>@chemical$ 7-ketodeoxycholic acid @/chemical$</e21>, and <e22>@chemical$ lithocholic acid @/chemical$</e22>. It is consistent with the BA-metabolizing genomic changes in the <e23>@microbiome$ LDSD gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e23> characterized by overabundances of <e24>@bacteria$ 7-dehydroxylating bacteria @/bacteria$</e24> and <e25>@gene$ BA-inducible genes @/gene$</e25> (<e26>@gene$ baiCD/E/H @/gene$</e26>). The score of bowel symptoms (stool frequency and <e27>@DDF$ abdominal pain @/DDF$</e27>) showing greater severity in the LDSD pattern were positively correlated with bai-expressing bacterial abundances and fecal DCA levels separately. We clarified a differed BA metabolic phenotype in <e28>@human$ IBS patients @/human$</e28> with <e29>@DDF$ LDSD @/DDF$</e29>, which closely correlates with the severity of bowel symptoms. It demonstrates that <e30>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e30> and host co-metabolism of <e31>@chemical$ BAs @/chemical$</e31> would provide crucial insight into the biology of the LDSD pattern and its internal relationship with IBS progression."

The <e8>@anatomical location$ vagus nerve @/anatomical location$</e8>, the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system, is involved in the regulation of immune response, digestion, heart rate, and control of mood. It can detect microbiota metabolites through its afferents, transferring this gut information to the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the important role played by the <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e9> and gut-related factors in disease development and progression, as well as treatment responses. These findings suggest that the <e10>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e10> may be a valuable target for new therapeutic strategies for <e11>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e11>.

The pathogenesis of <e17>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e17> is believed to involve <e18>@DDF$ oxidative stress @/DDF$</e18>, <e19>@DDF$ disruption to mitochondria @/DDF$</e19>, <e20>@DDF$ alterations to the protein \u03b1-synuclein @/DDF$</e20>, and <e21>@DDF$ neuroinflammatory processes @/DDF$</e21>. There is currently no cure for the disease. <e22>@chemical$ Polyphenols @/chemical$</e22> are secondary metabolites of plants, which have shown benefit in several experimental models of <e23>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e23>. Intake of <e24>@chemical$ polyphenols @/chemical$</e24> through diet is also associated with lower PD risk in <e25>@human$ humans @/human$</e25>. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathology of <e26>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e26> and the data supporting the potential neuroprotective capacity of increased <e27>@chemical$ polyphenols @/chemical$</e27> in the diet. Evidence suggests that the intake of <e28>@anatomical location$ dietary polyphenols @/anatomical location$</e28> may inhibit <e29>@DDF$ neurodegeneration @/DDF$</e29> and the <e30>@DDF$ progression of PD @/DDF$</e30>. <e31>@chemical$ Polyphenols @/chemical$</e31> appear to have a positive effect on the <e32>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e32>, which may decrease <e33>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e33> that contributes to the disease. Therefore, a diet rich in <e34>@chemical$ polyphenols @/chemical$</e34> may decrease the symptoms and increase quality of life in <e35>@human$ PD patients @/human$</e35>."

      "abstract_tagged": "In light of recent data, microorganisms should be construed as organisms that are capable of communication and collective behaviors. Microbial communication signals are involved both in interactions among microbial cells within microbial social systems, including the human body-inhabiting microconsortium, and the dialog between the microbiota and the host organism. The microbiota inhabits various niches of the host organism, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microorganisms release diverse signal molecules and, in addition, specifically respond to host signals. This enables them to constantly interact with the nervous system including the <e4>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e4> and the immune system of the host organism. Evolutionarily conserved signals that are involved in the communication between microbiota and the host include neuroactive substances (neurochemicals) such as <e5>@chemical$ peptides @/chemical$</e5>, <e6>@chemical$ amino acids @/chemical$</e6>, <e7>@chemical$ biogenic amines @/chemical$</e7>, <e8>@chemical$ short-chain fatty acids @/chemical$</e8>, and gaseous substances. This ongoing dialog may either stabilize the host's physical and mental health state or, alternatively, cause serious health problems. Attempts are made to correct imbalances in the brain-gut-microbiota axis with <e9>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e9> including their subgroup called <e10>@dietary supplement$ psychobiotics @/dietary supplement$</e10> that release neuroactive substances directly influencing the <e11>@anatomical location$ human brain @/anatomical location$</e11>, psyche, and behavior. A number of recent review works address the microbiota-host system and its communication signals. Some of the publications focus on the involvement of neurochemicals in the bidirectional communication within the host-microbiota system. However, this work concentrates on the impact of bacterial cell components, metabolites, and signal molecules as promising alternatives to the currently widespread <e12>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e12> that have both advantages and disadvantages. Such biologically active agents of microbial origin are referred to as postbiotics or, alternatively, metabiotics (the term preferred in this work)."

Methods Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal).

We retrospectively examined the <e9>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e9> and clinical evaluation of 129 <e10>@human$ adults @/human$</e10> (94 <e11>@human$ PLWH @/human$</e11> and 35 HIV-) enrolled at UC San Diego's HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program. A subset of <e12>@human$ participants @/human$</e12> (32 <e13>@human$ PLWH @/human$</e13> vs. 13 HIV-) underwent an emotional assessment using the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery summarized by three composite scores (negative affect, social satisfaction, and psychological well-being). We then sequenced the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions from stool and performed taxonomic assignment using CLC Microbial Genomics Module. The <e14>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> profiles were evaluated in relation to participants' emotional assessment. All analyses were done in R statistical software. We found that the relative abundance of <e15>@bacteria$ aerotolerant bacteria @/bacteria$</e15> was significantly higher in <e16>@human$ PLWH @/human$</e16> (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and was associated with a lifetime major depression diagnosis independently of HIV status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Moreover, <e17>@human$ PLWH @/human$</e17> experienced significantly worse psychological well-being (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), less social satisfaction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and more negative affect (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Higher levels of <e18>@bacteria$ aerotolerant bacteria @/bacteria$</e18> were associated with worse psychological well-being (rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), less social satisfaction (r\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and more negative affect (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.46, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The association of <e19>@bacteria$ aerotolerant bacteria @/bacteria$</e19> with social satisfaction and negative affect was independent of HIV status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, for both). The over-representation of <e20>@bacteria$ aerotolerant bacteria @/bacteria$</e20> in the <e21>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e21> may reflect worse oxidative stress and barrier defects and may contribute to <e22>@DDF$ emotional distress @/DDF$</e22> during <e23>@DDF$ HIV infection @/DDF$</e23>."

In this narrative review, we summarize the potential roles of <e14>@DDF$ gut microbial dysbiosis @/DDF$</e14> in <e15>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e15>, with emphasis on <e16>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e16> and mitochondrial function. We then review the possible ways in which <e17>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e17> affect the central nervous system, as well as the impact of <e18>@chemical$ microbial metabolites @/chemical$</e18> on <e19>@DDF$ mitochondrial dysfunction @/DDF$</e19>. We finally discuss the possibility of <e20>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e20> as a therapeutic target for <e21>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e21>."

To guide future clinical trials and targeted dietary therapies, this review provides an overview of what is currently known regarding underlying mechanisms of action by which diet may influence mental and brain health. The mechanisms of action associating diet with health outcomes are complex, multifaceted, interacting, and not restricted to any one biological pathway. Numerous pathways were identified through which diet could plausibly affect mental health. These include modulation of pathways involved in <e3>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e3>, <e4>@DDF$ oxidative stress @/DDF$</e4>, epigenetics, <e5>@DDF$ mitochondrial dysfunction @/DDF$</e5>, the <e6>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e6>, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, the HPA axis, neurogenesis and <e7>@chemical$ BDNF @/chemical$</e7>, epigenetics, and <e8>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e8>.

This manuscript also discusses how the <e25>@drug$ psychotropics @/drug$</e25> used to treat these conditions may have an antimicrobial effect on <e26>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e26>, and the potential for new strategies of management with <e27>@dietary supplement$ probiotics @/dietary supplement$</e27> and faecal transplantation. This understanding can open up the need for a gut related approach in these disorders as well as unlock the door for the role of gut related microbiota management.

Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these health issues is a major public health challenge. Based on recent findings, from studies conducted on animal models of <e8>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e8>, it has been proposed that inflammatory processes may participate in both the <e9>@DDF$ peripheral and brain disorders @/DDF$</e9> associated with the <e10>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e10> condition including the development of <e11>@DDF$ emotional and cognitive alterations @/DDF$</e11>.

The pathophysiological model of <e5>@DDF$ rosacea @/DDF$</e5> involves an unbalanced immune system predisposed to excessive <e6>@DDF$ inflammation @/DDF$</e6>, in addition to <e7>@DDF$ vascular and nervous alterations @/DDF$</e7>, being certain cutaneous microorganisms' triggers of the symptoms onset. The gut-skin axis explains a bidirectional interaction between <e8>@microbiome$ skin and gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e8> in some <e9>@DDF$ inflammatory skin diseases @/DDF$</e9> such as <e10>@DDF$ atopic dermatitis @/DDF$</e10>, <e11>@DDF$ psoriasis @/DDF$</e11>, or <e12>@DDF$ rosacea @/DDF$</e12>. The introduction and consolidation of the <e13>@biomedical technique$ next-generation sequencing @/biomedical technique$</e13> in recent years has provided unprecedented information about the microbiome. However, the characterization of the <e14>@microbiome$ gut and skin microbiota @/microbiome$</e14> and the impact of the gut-skin axis in <e15>@human$ patients @/human$</e15> with <e16>@DDF$ rosacea @/DDF$</e16> has been little explored, in contrast to other <e17>@DDF$ inflammatory skin diseases @/DDF$</e17> such as <e18>@DDF$ atopic dermatitis @/DDF$</e18> or <e19>@DDF$ psoriasis @/DDF$</e19>. Furthermore, the clinical evolution of <e20>@human$ patients @/human$</e20> with <e21>@DDF$ rosacea @/DDF$</e21> is not always adequate and it is common for them to present a sustained <e22>@DDF$ symptomatology @/DDF$</e22> with frequent <e23>@DDF$ flare-ups @/DDF$</e23>. In this context, <e24>@dietary supplement$ probiotic supplementation @/dietary supplement$</e24> could improve the clinical evolution of these <e25>@human$ patients @/human$</e25> as happens in other pathologies. Through this review we aim to establish and compile the basics and directions of current knowledge to understand the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences the pathogenesis of <e26>@DDF$ rosacea @/DDF$</e26>, and how modulation of the <e27>@microbiome$ skin and gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e27> could benefit these <e28>@human$ patients @/human$</e28>."

It is becoming increasingly clear that major players in this complex system are <e4>@bacteria$ gut bacteria @/bacteria$</e4>. The mechanisms of signal transmission from bacteria to the <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> are complex and not fully elucidated, but include neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. It was initially demonstrated in a rodent model of <e6>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e6> that the <e7>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e7> was altered. This observation has been replicated in <e8>@human$ patients @/human$</e8> with <e9>@DDF$ major depression @/DDF$</e9> who show decreased microbial diversity. Furthermore, when <e10>@animal$ rodents @/animal$</e10> receive a microbiota transplant from a <e11>@human$ depressed patient @/human$</e11> their behaviour alters, as does their tryptophan metabolism and immune status. Several studies of <e12>@bacteria$ psychobiotics @/bacteria$</e12> (bacteria with a potential mental health benefit) have been conducted in <e13>@human$ healthy populations @/human$</e13> and in <e14>@human$ patients @/human$</e14> with <e15>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e15>. While some <e16>@bacteria$ psychobiotics @/bacteria$</e16> have shown efficacy in treating <e17>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e17>, other bacteria have yielded negative findings. Larger-scale, well-designed studies are required. EU-funded guidelines recommend that <e18>@human$ patients @/human$</e18> with <e19>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e19> or vulnerability to <e20>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e20> should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of <e21>@food$ grains @/food$</e21>/<e22>@food$ fibres @/food$</e22>, <e23>@food$ fermented foods @/food$</e23>, and <e24>@food$ fish @/food$</e24>.

      "abstract_tagged": "Mental health is determined by a complex interplay between the Neurological Exposome and the Human Genome. Multiple genetic and non-genetic (exposome) factors interact early in life, modulating the risk of developing the most common complex <e2>@DDF$ neurodevelopmental disorders @/DDF$</e2> (<e3>@DDF$ NDDs @/DDF$</e3>), with potential long-term consequences on health. To date, the understating of the precise etiology underpinning these <e4>@DDF$ neurological alterations @/DDF$</e4>, and their clinical management pose a challenge. The crucial role played by diet and <e5>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e5> in brain development and functioning would indicate that modulating the gut-brain axis may help protect against the onset and progression of <e6>@DDF$ mental-health disorders @/DDF$</e6>. Some <e7>@DDF$ nutritional deficiencies @/DDF$</e7> and <e8>@DDF$ gut microbiota alterations @/DDF$</e8> have been linked to <e9>@DDF$ NDDs @/DDF$</e9>, suggesting their potential pathogenic implications. In addition, certain dietary interventions have emerged as promising alternatives or adjuvant strategies for improving the management of particular <e10>@DDF$ NDDs @/DDF$</e10>, at least in particular subsets of subjects. The <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e11> can be a key to mediating the effects of other exposome factors such as diet on mental health, and ongoing research in Psychiatry and Neuropediatrics is developing Precision Nutrition Models to classify subjects according to a diet response prediction based on specific individual features, including microbiome signatures. Here, we review current scientific evidence for the impact of early life environmental factors, including diet, on <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> and neuro-development, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences on health; and also summarize the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying diet and <e13>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e13> influence on the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we describe the evidence supporting the key role played by <e14>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e14>, diet and nutrition in neurodevelopment, as well as the effectiveness of certain dietary and microbiome-based interventions aimed at preventing or treating <e15>@DDF$ NDDs @/DDF$</e15>. Finally, we emphasize the need for further research to gain greater insight into the complex interplay between diet, <e16>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e16> and brain development. Such knowledge would help towards achieving tailored integrative treatments, including personalized nutrition."

Disturbance of <e11>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e11> was involved in <e12>@DDF$ SCZ @/DDF$</e12>. However, it remains unclear whether <e13>@chemical$ PM @/chemical$</e13> induces <e14>@DDF$ SCZ-like symptoms @/DDF$</e14> and how <e15>@microbiome$ gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e15> regulates them. Therefore, a <e16>@biomedical technique$ multi-omics animal experiment @/biomedical technique$</e16> was conducted to verify how <e17>@chemical$ urban PM @/chemical$</e17> induces <e18>@DDF$ SCZ-like behavior @/DDF$</e18> and altered <e19>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e19> and metabolic pathways.

Besides, <e30>@microbiome$ fecal microbiome @/microbiome$</e30> of PM group and control group were transplanted into \"<e31>@animal$ pseudo-sterile\" mice @/animal$</e31>, then <e32>@biomedical technique$ behavioral tests @/biomedical technique$</e32> were conducted. Similar to MK801 group, <e33>@animal$ mice @/animal$</e33> in <e34>@animal$ PM group @/animal$</e34> showed SCZ-like symptoms, including increased spontaneous activity, <e35>@DDF$ excitability @/DDF$</e35>, <e36>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e36> and decreased learning and spatial memory. <e37>@chemical$ PM @/chemical$</e37> exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of <e38>@bacteria$ Verrucomicrobia @/bacteria$</e38> and decreased that of <e39>@bacteria$ Fibrobacteres @/bacteria$</e39> et al.

      "abstract_tagged": "<e2>@DDF$ Anhedonia @/DDF$</e2> and <e3>@DDF$ amotivation @/DDF$</e3> are debilitating symptoms and represent unmet therapeutic needs in a range of clinical conditions. The gut-microbiome-endocannabinoid axis might represent a potential modifiable target for interventions. Based on results obtained from animal models, we tested the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbiome diversity and <e4>@DDF$ anhedonia/amotivation @/DDF$</e4> in a general population cohort. We used longitudinal data collected from 786 <e5>@human$ volunteer twins @/human$</e5> recruited as part the TwinsUK register. Our hypothesis was tested with a <e6>@statistical technique$ multilevel mediation model @/statistical technique$</e6> using family structure as random intercept. The model was set using alpha diversity (within-individual gut-microbial diversity) as predictor, serum and faecal levels of the <e7>@chemical$ endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide @/chemical$</e7> (<e8>@chemical$ PEA @/chemical$</e8>) as mediator, and <e9>@DDF$ anhedonia/amotivation @/DDF$</e9> as outcome. <e10>@chemical$ PEA @/chemical$</e10> is considered the endogenous equivalent of <e11>@chemical$ cannabidiol @/chemical$</e11>, with increased serum levels believed to have anti-depressive effects, while increased stool PEA levels, reflecting increased excretion, are believed to have opposite, detrimental, effects on mental health. We therefore expected that either reduced serum PEA or increased stool PEA would mediate the association between microbial diversity and <e12>@DDF$ anhedonia amotivation @/DDF$</e12>. Analyses were adjusted for <e13>@DDF$ obesity @/DDF$</e13>, diet, antidepressant use, sociodemographic and technical covariates. Data were imputed using <e14>@statistical technique$ multiple imputation by chained equations @/statistical technique$</e14>. Mean age was 65.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6; 93% of the sample were <e15>@human$ females @/human$</e15>. We found a direct, significant, association between alpha diversity and <e16>@DDF$ anhedonia/amotivation @/DDF$</e16> (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.37; 95%CI: -0.71 to -0.03; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Faecal, but not serum, levels of the <e17>@chemical$ endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide @/chemical$</e17> (<e18>@chemical$ PEA @/chemical$</e18>) mediated this association: the indirect effect was significant (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.13; 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u20090.03), as was the total effect (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.38; 95%CI: -0.72 to -0.04; P\u2009=\u20090.03), whereas the direct effect of alpha diversity on <e19>@DDF$ anhedonia/amotivation @/DDF$</e19> was attenuated fully (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.25; 95%CI: -0.60 to 0.09; P\u2009=\u20090.16). Our results suggest that gut-microbial diversity might contribute to anhedonia/amotivation via the endocannabinoid system. These findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of anhedonia/amotivation and suggest the gut microbiota-endocannabinoid axis as a promising therapeutic target in an area of unmet clinical need."

Our results point to an intriguing new hypothesis: that biodiverse soils may represent an important supplementary source of <e16>@bacteria$ butyrate-producing bacteria @/bacteria$</e16> capable of resupplying the <e17>@microbiome$ mammalian gut microbiome @/microbiome$</e17>, with potential for gut health and mental health benefits.

The availability of powerful genetic tools and resources in <i><e8>@animal$ Drosophila @/animal$</e8></i> allowed the scientists to unravel the mechanisms by which the gut microbes affect fitness, health, and behavior of their hosts. <i>Drosophila</i> models have been extensively used not only to study animal behaviors (i.e., courtship, aggression, sleep, and learning & memory), but also some <e9>@DDF$ human related neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e9> (i.e., <e10>@DDF$ Alzheimer's disease @/DDF$</e10> and <e11>@DDF$ Parkinson's disease @/DDF$</e11>) in the past. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the <e12>@microbiome$ gut microbiota @/microbiome$</e12> of <i><e13>@animal$ Drosophila @/animal$</e13></i> and its impact on fly behavior, physiology, and <e14>@DDF$ neurodegenerative diseases @/DDF$</e14>."

Further, <e10>@DDF$ impaired sleep and circadian patterns @/DDF$</e10> are common symptoms of <e11>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e11>, while <e12>@DDF$ sleep and circadian rhythm disruption @/DDF$</e12> (<e13>@DDF$ SCRD @/DDF$</e13>) is associated with greater <e14>@chemical$ \u03b2-amyloid @/chemical$</e14> (<e15>@chemical$ A\u03b2 @/chemical$</e15>) burden and AD risk, sometimes years before the clinical onset of <e16>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e16>. Moreover, reports have demonstrated that <e17>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e17> and its metabolites exhibit diurnal rhythmicity and the role of <e18>@DDF$ SCRD @/DDF$</e18> in dampening the GM rhythmicity and eubiosis. This review will provide an evaluation of clinical and animal studies describing <e19>@DDF$ GM alterations @/DDF$</e19> in distinct conditions, including <e20>@DDF$ AD @/DDF$</e20>, <e21>@DDF$ sleep and circadian disruption @/DDF$</e21>. It aims to identify the overlapping and distinctive <e22>@DDF$ GM alterations @/DDF$</e22> in these conditions and their contributions to pathophysiology. Although most studies are observational and use different methodologies, data indicate partial commonalities in <e23>@DDF$ GM alterations @/DDF$</e23> and unanimity at functional level. Finally, we discuss the possible interactions between <e24>@DDF$ SCRD @/DDF$</e24> and <e25>@microbiome$ GM @/microbiome$</e25> in AD pathogenesis, as well as several methodological improvements that are necessary for future research."
