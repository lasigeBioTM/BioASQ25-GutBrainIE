    "abstract": "Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain.Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome.Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research.",

The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis. In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument. SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (\u03c1\u00a0= 0.34, <i>q</i> \u2264 .1). Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome. Cognitive function of patients with SCZ is associated with the potential for gut bacterial biosynthesis of tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, suggesting that gut microbiota might be an intervention target for alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis and membrane dysfunction in the brain has attracted increasing attention in the field of psychiatric research. However, the possible interactive role of gut microbiota and brain function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet. To explore this, we collected fecal samples and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC). Then we analyzed the differences in gut microbiota and choline concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Presences of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales were observed at increase levels in fecal samples of UHR subjects compared to the other two groups. The composition changes of gut microbiota indicate the increased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of choline levels, a brain imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups. Both gut microbiome and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the brain and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of schizophrenia.",

Probiotics with potential mental health benefits (psychobiotics) can alter the gut-brain axis via immunological, humoral, neuronal, and metabolic pathways. Recently, probiotic bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> have been demonstrated for SCFAs production, which play a crucial role in a variety of diseases. These acids could enhance the production of mucins, antimicrobial proteins (bacteriocins and peptides), cytokines (Interleukin 10 and 18) and neurotransmitters (serotonin) in the intestine to main the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier system and other immune functions.

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction (AIMD) is an intractable clinical challenge worldwide. The situation is becoming more critical as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), to a great extent, have replaced the role of first-generation antipsychotics in managing major psychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms for developing AIMD is intricate, emerging evidence has indicated the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AIMD. SGAs treatment may change the diversity and compositions of intestinal flora (e.g., decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased Firmicutes). Short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites derived from gut microbiota, on the one hand, can regulate the activity of intestinal endocrine cells and their secretion of satiety hormones (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, cholecystokinin and ghrelin); on the other hand, can activate the vagus nerve or transport into the brain to exert a central modulation of foraging behaviors via binding to neuropeptide receptors. Interestingly, metformin, a classical antidiabetic agent, is capable of alleviating AIMD possibly by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. That is, metformin can not only partially reverse the alterations of gut microbial communities due to SGAs treatment, but also play a positive role in rectifying the disturbances of peripheral and central satiety-related neuropeptides. Current evidence has indicated a promising role for metformin on ameliorating AMID, but further verifications in well-designed clinical trials are still warranted.",

Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10/mice/group) were randomly assigned to receive (1) control diet (CTR), control diet treated with antibiotics (AB), control diet with total 5000 IU of VD (VD), VD treated with antibiotics (VD + AB), VD supplemented with 5% w/w fructooligosaccharides (FOS; VF), and VF diet treated with antibiotics (VF + AB), respectively, for 8 weeks. Our study demonstrated that VD status was not affected by antibiotic regimen. VD alone ameliorates anxiety-related behavior in female mice, and that combination with FOS (i.e., VF) did not further improve the outcome. Male mice, in contrast, exhibit greater anxiety with VF, but not VD, when compared with CTR mice. Colonic VD receptor was elevated in VF-treated mice in both sexes, compared with CTR, which was positively correlated to colonic TPH1, a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of VF on anxiety-related behavior is sex-specific, which may partially be attributed to the activation of colonic VD signaling and subsequent serotonin synthesis. The synergistic or additive effect of VD and FOS on mood disorders remained to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence shows that the gut microbiota, an important player within the gut-brain communication axis, can affect metabolism, inflammation, brain function and behavior. Interestingly, gut microbiota composition is known to be altered in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), who also often display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of prebiotics, which beneficially alters the microbiota, may therefore be a promising way to potentially improve physical and mental health in MetS patients. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of MetS, namely the obese and type-2 diabetic db/db mice, which display emotional and cognitive alterations associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and hippocampal inflammation compared to their lean db/+ littermates. We assessed the impact of chronic administration (8weeks) of prebiotics (oligofructose) on both metabolic (body weight, food intake, glucose homeostasis) and behavioral (increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial memory) alterations characterizing db/db mice, as well as related neurobiological correlates, with particular attention to neuroinflammatory processes. Prebiotic administration improved excessive food intake and glycemic dysregulations (glucose tolerance and insulin resistance) in db/db mice. This was accompanied by an increase of plasma anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels and hypothalamic mRNA expression of the anorexigenic cytokine IL-1\u03b2, whereas unbalanced mRNA expression of hypothalamic orexigenic (NPY) and anorexigenic (CART, POMC) peptides was unchanged. We also detected signs of improved blood-brain-barrier integrity in the hypothalamus of oligofructose-treated db/db mice (normalized expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin). On the contrary, prebiotic administration did not improve behavioral alterations and associated reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis displayed by db/db mice, despite normalization of increased hippocampal IL-6 mRNA expression. Of note, we found a relationship between the effect of treatment on dentate gyrus neurons and spatial memory. These findings may prove valuable for introducing novel approaches to treat some of the comorbidities associated with MetS.",

Interestingly, gut microbiota composition is known to be altered in patients with metabolic syndrome (<e1>@DDF$ MetS)@/DDF$</e1> , who also often display <e2>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric symptoms.@/DDF$</e2>  The use of prebiotics, which beneficially alters the microbiota, may therefore be a promising way to potentially improve physical and mental health in <e3>@DDF$ MetS @/DDF$</e3> patients. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of MetS, namely the obese and type-2 diabetic db/db mice, which display emotional and cognitive alterations associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and hippocampal inflammation compared to their lean db/+ littermates. We assessed the impact of chronic administration (8weeks) of prebiotics (oligofructose) on both metabolic (body weight, food intake, glucose homeostasis) and behavioral (increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial memory) alterations characterizing db/db mice, as well as related neurobiological correlates, with particular attention to neuroinflammatory processes. Prebiotic administration improved excessive food intake and glycemic dysregulations (glucose tolerance and insulin resistance) in db/db mice. This was accompanied by an increase of plasma anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels and <e4>@anatomical location$ hypothalamic @/anatomical location$</e4> mRNA expression of the anorexigenic cytokine <e5>@gene$ IL-1\u03b2,@/gene$</e5>  whereas unbalanced mRNA expression of <e6>@anatomical location$ hypothalamic @/anatomical location$</e6> orexigenic (<e7>@gene$ NPY)@/gene$</e7>  and anorexigenic (<e8>@gene$ CART,@/gene$</e8>  <e9>@gene$ POMC)@/gene$</e9>  peptides was unchanged.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is marked clinically by motor dysfunction and pathologically by dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. The driver underlying iron accumulation remains unknown and could be genetic or environmental. The HFE protein is critical for the regulation of cellular iron uptake. Mutations within this protein are associated with increased iron accumulation including in the brain. We have focused on the commonly occurring H63D variant of the HFE gene as a disease modifier in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the role of H63D HFE genotype, we generated a mouse model in which the wild-type (WT) HFE gene is replaced by the H67D gene variant (mouse homolog of the human H63D gene variant). Using paraquat toxicity as the model for Parkinson's disease, we found that WT mice responded as expected with significantly greater motor function, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase staining and increase microglial staining in the substantia nigra, and an increase in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rate within the substantia nigra of the paraquat-treated mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. In contrast, the H67D mice showed a remarkable resistance to paraquat treatment; specifically differing from the WT mice with no changes in motor function or changes in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates following paraquat exposure. At baseline, there were differences between the H67D HFE mice and WT mice in gut microbiome profile and increased L-ferritin staining in the substantia nigra that could account for the resistance to paraquat. Of particular note, the H67D HFE mice regardless of whether or not they were treated with paraquat had significantly less tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining than WT. Our results clearly demonstrate that the HFE genotype impacts the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, the gut microbiome and the response to paraquat providing additional support that the HFE genotype is a disease modifier for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the finding that the HFE mutant mice are resistant to paraquat may provide a model in which to study resistant mechanisms to neurotoxicants.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between body systems in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with non-communicable chronic diseases whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the gut or brain, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the gut microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the brain in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of gut-brain interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of gut-brain axis research, focusing on neuro-immune-microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-gut-brain research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the brain.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human SNCA gene (SNCA-TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of PD to study whether environmental conditions such as standard <i>vs.</i> enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and SNCA-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in SNCA-TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. was a significant changed in the SNCA-TG mice. EE significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in WT and SNCA-TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the feces and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders, focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade.",

Result showed that fecal microbiota transplantation increased the consumption of sucrose solutions and decreased the immobility time in forced swimming test. This treatment also increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes and Desulfobacterota at phylum levels; reduced the loss of villi and epithelial cells; suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum; increased the expression of ZO-1, occludin; protected the mucosal layer function; and suppressed the high levels of inflammasomes (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2) in rat brain. In summary, fecal microbiota transplantation improves the depressive-like behavior, alters the gut microbiota imbalance, and alleviates the intestinal tract inflammation, intestinal mucosa disruption, and neuroinflammation in rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.",

Ageing is characterized by an increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that has been termed \"inflammageing\". The inflammatory response is beneficial as an acute, transient reaction to harmful conditions, facilitating the defense, repair, turnover and adaptation of many tissues. However, chronic and low grade inflammation is likely to be detrimental for many tissues and for normal functions. We provide an overview of low grade inflammation (LGI) and determine the potential drivers and the effects of the \"inflamed\" phenotype observed in the elderly. We discuss the role of gut microbiota and immune system crosstalk and the gut-brain axis. Then, we focus on major health complications associated with LGI in the elderly, including mental health and wellbeing, metabolic abnormalities and infections. Finally, we discuss the possibility of manipulating LGI in the elderly by nutritional interventions. We provide an overview of the evidence that exists in the elderly for omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic, prebiotic, antioxidant and polyphenol interventions as a means to influence LGI. We conclude that slowing, controlling or reversing LGI is likely to be an important way to prevent, or reduce the severity of, age-related functional decline and the onset of conditions affecting health and well-being; that there is evidence to support specific dietary interventions as a strategy to control LGI; and that a continued research focus on this field is warranted.",

Among micronutrients, B vitamins have evolved prior to DNA/RNA and are known for their vital roles for major evolutionary transitions in extant organisms. Despite their universal requirement and critical role, not all the three domains of life are endowed with a natural ability for <i>de novo</i> B vitamins synthesis. The human gut microbiome constitutes prototrophs and auxotroph which are entirely dependent on dietary intake and gut microbial production of B vitamins. The syntrophic metabolism involving cross-feeding of B vitamins and community-wide exchange between commensal bacteria elicit important changes in the diversity and composition of the human gut microbiome. Hereto, we discuss the B-vitamins sharing among prototrophic and auxotrophic gut bacteria, their absorption in small intestine and transport in distal gut, functional role in relation to the gut homeostasis and symptoms linked to their deficiency. We also briefly explore their potential involvement as psychobiotics in brain energetic metabolism (kynurenines/tryptophan pathway) for neurological functions and highlight their deficiency related malfunctioning.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders are on the rise; however, efforts to develop new and effective treatment strategies have had limited success. To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the gut microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the oral microbiota are limited. The oral cavity houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the soft and hard tissues. Periodontal diseases encompass a group of infectious and inflammatory diseases that affect the periodontium. Among them, periodontitis is defined as a chronic, multi-bacterial infection that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation <i>via</i> the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of periodontal pathogens. Periodontitis can also induce or exacerbate other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia), especially as dysregulation of the immune system also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders. Epidemiological data of periodontal diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system. Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the oral microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract_tagged": "The prevalence of anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders are on the rise; however, efforts to develop new and effective treatment strategies have had limited success. To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the <e2>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e2> microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the <e3>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e3> microbiota are limited. The <e4>@anatomical location$ oral cavity @/anatomical location$</e4> houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the <e5>@anatomical location$ soft and hard tissues.@/anatomical location$</e5>  <e6>@anatomical location$ Periodontal @/anatomical location$</e6> diseases encompass a group of <e7>@DDF$ infectious and inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e7> that affect the <e8>@anatomical location$ periodontium.@/anatomical location$</e8>  Among them, <e9>@DDF$ periodontitis @/DDF$</e9> is defined as a <e10>@DDF$ chronic, multi-bacterial infection @/DDF$</e10> that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation <i>via</i> the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of <e11>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e11> pathogens. <e12>@DDF$ Periodontitis @/DDF$</e12> can also induce or exacerbate other <e13>@DDF$ chronic systemic inflammatory diseases @/DDF$</e13> such as <e14>@DDF$ atherosclerosis @/DDF$</e14> and <e15>@DDF$ diabetes @/DDF$</e15> and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of <e16>@DDF$ neuropsychiatric disorders @/DDF$</e16> (such as <e17>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e17> and <e18>@DDF$ schizophrenia)@/DDF$</e18> , especially as dysregulation of the <e19>@anatomical location$ immune system @/anatomical location$</e19> also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the <e20>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e20> microbiota associated with <e21>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e21> diseases in <e22>@DDF$ anxiety,@/DDF$</e22>  mood and <e23>@DDF$ trauma- @/DDF$</e23> and <e24>@DDF$ stress-related disorders.@/DDF$</e24>  Epidemiological data of <e25>@anatomical location$ periodontal @/anatomical location$</e25> diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the <e26>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e26> microbiota and the <e27>@anatomical location$ central nervous system.@/anatomical location$</e27>  Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the <e28>@anatomical location$ oral @/anatomical location$</e28> microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.",

    "journal": "Cureus",
    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Second-generation antipsychotics are mainly used in both acute and long-term treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Although better tolerated than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, they can frequently induce weight gain and metabolic disorders, of these, olanzapine is one of the drugs more likely to induce these side effects. There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation. Second-generation antipsychotics induce important gut microbiota modification thus contributing together with the central and peripheral receptors blockade mechanism to weight gain induction and metabolic impairment. These drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota and induce dysbiosis, often reducing the concentration of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, a bacterium that is also decreased in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Probiotic administration can be a safe and well-tolerated approach to modulate microbiota\u00a0and\u00a0offer an integrative strategy in psychiatric patients suffering antipsychotic side effects. Multiple strain probiotics and <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> alone have been administered both in mice models and in clinical populations demonstrating efficacy on antipsychotic-induced metabolic impairment and showing a contribution in reducing induced weight gain.\u00a0<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> can improve several parameters altered by olanzapine administration, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, liver function, systemic inflammation, and gut barrier function. Although we do not have jet trials in the psychiatric population, this probiotic may be a complementary approach to treating olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic side effects.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies report that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can adversely affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal uptake of micronutrients, in particular iron and magnesium, and are used frequently by kidney transplant recipients. Altered gut microbiota, iron deficiency, and magnesium deficiency have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population. Cross-sectional study. Kidney transplant recipients (\u22651 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study. PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use. Fatigue and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire. Logistic and linear regression. We included 937 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 56\u00b113 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. PPI use was associated with fatigue severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe fatigue (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI,\u00a0-11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI,\u00a0-7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of upper gastrointestinal disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with fatigue severity. Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships. PPI use is independently associated with fatigue and lower HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted. In this observational study, we investigated the association of proton pump inhibitors with fatigue and health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Our data showed that proton pump inhibitors were independently associated with fatigue severity, severe fatigue, and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed proton pump inhibitor types and were dose dependent. While we await future studies on this topic, proton pump inhibitor use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic use is one of the strongest environmental predictors of an altered and less diverse gut microbiome, which has been linked to Parkinson's disease. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the association between long-term antibiotic use and Parkinson's disease. We conducted a prospective study of 59,637 women in the Nurses' Health Study who reported total duration of antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, 60\u2009+, or during the past 4 years. We used Cox Proportional Hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between categories of antibiotic use and risk of PD. One hundred and eighty cases of PD were confirmed during the follow-up. Self-reported antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, and 60\u2009+, as assessed in 2004, was not significantly associated with PD risk in our cohort. The hazard ratio comparing participants who used antibiotics for 2 or more months vs. 1-14 days at age 20-39 was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.78), at age 40-59 was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.33), and at age 60\u2009+was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.47). Antibiotic use during the past four years, as assessed in 2008, was also not associated with future risk of PD (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.10). In this cohort study, we did not observe a significant association between antibiotic use and incidence PD. A major limitation of our study is assessment of exposure, which required many participants to recall their antibiotic use decades in the past. Thus, although the results of this study do not support an effect of antibiotic use on PD risk, larger investigations relying on records of antibiotic prescriptions would provide more definitive evidence.",

The hazard ratio comparing participants who used antibiotics for 2 or more months vs. 1-14 days at age 20-39 was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.78), at age 40-59 was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.33), and at age 60\u2009+was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.47). Antibiotic use during the past four years, as assessed in 2008, was also not associated with future risk of <e8>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e8> (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.10). In this cohort study, we did not observe a significant association between antibiotic use and incidence <e9>@DDF$ PD.@/DDF$</e9>  A major limitation of our study is assessment of exposure, which required many participants to recall their antibiotic use decades in the past. Thus, although the results of this study do not support an effect of antibiotic use on <e10>@DDF$ PD @/DDF$</e10> risk, larger investigations relying on records of antibiotic prescriptions would provide more definitive evidence.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, depression, and anxiety. Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of constipation and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the ileum. Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of constipation, possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa). PD has also been associated with altered gut microbiota composition. However, the effects of these PD medications on PD-related non-motor symptoms and the gut microbiota have not been well characterized. This study uses a transgenic mouse model of PD to help resolve medication-induced microbiota alterations from those that are potentially disease relevant within a PD context, and explores how long-term treatment may interact with the gut microbiota to impact non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorder with elusive etiology and obscure pathophysiology. Cognitive inabilities, impaired communication, repetitive behavior pattern, and restricted social interaction and communication lead to a debilitating situation in autism. The pattern of co-occurrence of medical comorbidities is most intriguing in autism, compared to any other neurodevelopmental disorders. They have an elevated comorbidity burden among which most frequently are seizures, psychiatric illness, and gastrointestinal disorders. The gut microbiota is believed to play a pivotal role in human health and disease through involvement in physiological homoeostasis, immunological development, glutathione metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc., which in a reasonable way explain the role of gut-brain axis in autism. Branded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with psychiatric impairment and often misclassified as a mental disorder, many experts in the field think that a therapeutic solution to autism is unlikely to emerge. As the pathophysiology is still elusive, taking into account of the various symptoms that are concurrent in autism is important. Gastrointestinal problems that are seen associated with most of the autism cases suggest that it is not just a psychiatric disorder as many claim but have a physiological base, and alleviating the gastrointestinal problems could help alleviating the symptoms by bringing out the much needed overall improvement in the affected victims. A gut disorder akin to Crohn's disease is, sometimes, reported in autistic children, an extremely painful gastrointestinal disease which is named as autistic enterocolitis. This disturbed situation hypothesized to be initiated by dysbiosis or microbial imbalance could in turn perturb the coordination of microbiota-gut-brain axis which is important in human mental health as goes the popular dictum: \"fix your gut, fix your brain.\"",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including obesity, hyperphagia, and behavioral problems. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strain BPL1 has been shown to improve central adiposity in adults with simple obesity. To evaluate BPL1's effects in children with PWS, we performed a randomized crossover trial among 39 patients (mean age 10.4 years). Participants were randomized to placebo-BPL1 (<i>n</i> = 19) or BPL1-placebo (<i>n</i> = 20) sequences and underwent a 12-week period with placebo/BPL1 treatments, a 12-week washout period, and a 12-week period with the crossover treatment. Thirty-five subjects completed the study. The main outcome was changes in adiposity, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included lipid and glucose metabolism, hyperphagia, and mental health symptoms. Generalized linear modeling was applied to assess differences between treatments. While BPL1 did not modify total fat mass compared to placebo, BPL1 decreased abdominal adiposity in a subgroup of patients older than 4.5 years (<i>n</i> = 28). BPL1 improved fasting insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we observed modest improvements in some mental health symptoms. A follow-up trial with a longer treatment period is warranted to determine whether BPL1 supplementation can provide a long-term therapeutic approach for children with PWS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03548480).",

Autonomic symptoms of MSA include deficits associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) system, such as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain and bloating, nausea, delayed gastric emptying, and constipation. To date, studies assessing GI dysfunctions in MSA have primarily focused on alterations of the gut microbiome, however growing evidence indicates other structural components of the GI tract, such as the enteric nervous system, the intestinal barrier, GI hormones, and the GI-driven immune response may contribute to MSA-related GI symptoms. Here, we provide an in-depth exploration of the physiological, structural, and immunological changes theorised to underpin GI dysfunction in MSA patients and highlight areas for future research in order to identify more suitable pharmaceutical treatments for GI symptoms in patients with MSA.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. Its main pathological feature is the degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons related to the misfolding and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein. The pathogenesis of PD has not yet been fully elucidated, and its occurrence and development process are closely related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Dysregulation of intestinal microbiota may promote the damage of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal inflammation, and the upward diffusion of phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein from the enteric nervous system (ENS) to the brain in susceptible individuals and further lead to gastrointestinal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) through the disordered microbiota-gut-brain axis. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD, especially the mechanism of intestinal microbiome dysregulation, intestinal inflammation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD. Maintaining or restoring homeostasis in the gut microenvironment by targeting the gut microbiome may provide future direction for the development of new biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and therapeutic strategies to slow disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome that is diagnosed and staged based mainly on symptoms. We aimed to evaluate frailty-related alterations of the intestinal permeability and profile fecal microbiota of healthy and frail older adults to identify microbial biomarkers of this syndrome. We collected serum and fecal samples from 94 community-dwelling older adults, along with anthropometric, medical, mental health, and lifestyle data. Serum inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and HGMB1 and the intestinal permeability biomarker zonulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was performed to determine the fecal composition of fecal microbiota. We analyzed the diversity and composition differences of the gut microbiota in the two groups and assessed the relationship between the changes in microbiota structure and clinical biomarkers. Older adults with frailty showed higher concentrations of IL-6, HGMB1, and zonulin. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index and evenness indices or species richness of fecal microbiota between the two groups, we found significant microbiota structure differences. Compared with the control group, fecal samples from the frail group had higher levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Klebsiella</i> and lower levels of the commensal genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, and <i>Blautia.</i> Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the intergenus interactions were more common in healthy controls than older adults with frailty. <i>Escherichia</i>/<i>Shigella</i>, <i>Pyramidobacter</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were positively correlated with IL-6, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> were negatively correlated with IL-6. <i>Alistipes</i> were found to be positively correlated with HGMB1. <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i> were linked to the increased serum level of inflammatory factors and intestinal permeability. Frailty is associated with differences in the composition of fecal microbiota. These findings might aid in the development of probiotics or microbial-based therapies for frailty.",

    "abstract": "In adulthood, depression is the most common type of mental illness and will be the second leading cause of disease by 2020. Major depression dramatically affects the function of the central nervous system and degrades the quality of life, especially in old age. Several mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of depressive illness, since it has a multifactorial etiology. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that depression is mainly associated with imbalances in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, brain volume changes, neurogenesis dysfunction, and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways. Also the gut microbiota may influence mental health outcomes. Although depression is not a consequence of normal aging, depressive disorders are common in later life, even if often undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed in old age. When untreated, depression reduces life expectancy, worsens medical illnesses, enhances health care costs and is the primary cause of suicide among older people. To date, the underpinnings of depression in the elderly are still to be understood, and the pharmacological treatment is the most commonly used therapy. Since a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits have recently emerged as crucial contributors to the genesis and course of depression, in the present review, we have focused on the effects of physical activity and omega-3 fatty acids on depressive illness in the elderly. A growing literature indicates that both exercise and dietary interventions can promote mental health throughout one's lifespan. There thus emerges the awareness that an active lifestyle and a balanced diet may constitute valid low-cost prevention strategies to counteract depressive illness in the elderly.",

For a long time, PD was considered a brain disease characterized by motor disturbances; however, the identification of several risk factors and the hypothesis that PD has a gastrointestinal onset have shed additional light. Today, after recognition of prodromal non-motor symptoms and the pathological processes driving their evolution, there is a greater understanding of the involvement of other organ systems. For this reason, PD is increasingly seen as a multiorgan and multisystemic pathology that arises from the interaction of susceptible genetic factors with a challenging environment during aging-related decline.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of evidence has suggested that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying these links remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the impact of deregulation of intestinal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota. Administration of succinate markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice by elevating the mitochondrial membrane potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.",

    "abstract": "The bidirectional signaling between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis, is being heavily explored in current neuropsychiatric research. Analyses of the human gut microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence brain function, and potentially mood and anxiety symptoms, through gut-brain axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms by recolonizing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to FMT, which comprises 40 different strains of gut bacteria from a healthy donor. The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after administration of MET-2. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria, the safety and tolerability of MET-2, and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of depression/anxiety and the response to treatment. Adults experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, and GI symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from blood and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety. Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed. This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability. DERR1-10.2196/17223.",

Analyses of the human <e4>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e4> microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence <e5>@anatomical location$ brain @/anatomical location$</e5> function, and potentially mood and <e6>@DDF$ anxiety @/DDF$</e6> symptoms, through <e7>@anatomical location$ gut-brain @/anatomical location$</e7> axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that <e8>@anatomical location$ fecal @/anatomical location$</e8> microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of <e9>@DDF$ depression @/DDF$</e9> and <e10>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e10> by recolonizing the <e11>@anatomical location$ gastrointestinal (GI) tract @/anatomical location$</e11> with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to <e12>@biomedical technique$ FMT,@/biomedical technique$</e12>  which comprises 40 different strains of <e13>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e13> bacteria from a healthy donor. The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and <e14>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e14> before, during, and after administration of <e15>@chemical$ MET-2.@/chemical$</e15>  The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy <e16>@anatomical location$ gut @/anatomical location$</e16> bacteria, the safety and tolerability of <e17>@chemical$ MET-2,@/chemical$</e17>  and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of <e18>@DDF$ depression/anxiety @/DDF$</e18> and the response to treatment. Adults experiencing <e19>@DDF$ depressive @/DDF$</e19> or <e20>@DDF$ anxiety symptoms @/DDF$</e20> will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, <e21>@DDF$ anxiety,@/DDF$</e21>  and <e22>@anatomical location$ GI @/anatomical location$</e22> symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from <e23>@anatomical location$ blood @/anatomical location$</e23> and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety. Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed. This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability. DERR1-10.2196/17223.",

This study aimed to find out changes in the gut microbiota in bipolar depression (BD) subjects following treatment with quetiapine and evaluate their correlations with the brain and immune function. Totally 36 subjects with BD and 27 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The severity of depression was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). At baseline, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). T lymphocyte subsets were measured to examine immune function. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess brain function. All BD subjects received quetiapine treatment (300 mg/d) for four weeks, following which the fecal microbiota and immune profiles were reexamined. Here, we first put forward the new concept of brain-gut coefficient of balance (B-G<sub>CB</sub>), which referred to the ratio of [oxygenated hemoglobin]/(<i>Bifidobacteria</i> to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> ratio), to analyze the linkage between the gut microbiota and brain function. At baseline, the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion was positively correlated with log<sub>10</sub> Enterobacter spp count, whereas the correlativity between the other bacteria and immune profiles were negative. Log<sub>10</sub> B-G<sub>CB</sub> was positively correlated with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion. In subjects with BD, counts of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Bacteroides-Prevotella group</i>, <i>Atopobium Cluster</i>, <i>Enterobacter spp</i>, and <i>Clostridium Cluster IV</i> were higher, whereas the log<sub>10</sub> (B/E) were lower than HCs (B/E refers to <i>Bifidobacteria</i> to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> ratio and represents microbial colonization resistance). After treatment, MADRS scores were reduced, whereas the levels of <i>Eubacterium rectale</i>, <i>Bifidobacteria</i>, and B/E increased. The composition of the gut microbiota and its relationship to brain function were altered in BD subjects. Quetiapine treatment was effective for depression and influenced the composition of gut microbiota in patients. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx, identifier ChiCTR-COC-17011401, URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx.",

    "abstract": "The management of depression continues to be challenging despite the variety of available antidepressants. Herbal medicines are used in many cultures but lack stringent testing to understand their efficacy and mechanism of action. Isoalantolactone (LAT) from Elecampane (Inula helenium) improved the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced anhedonia-like phenotype in mice comparable to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Compare the effects of LAT and fluoxetine on depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to CSDS. The CSDS-induced decrease in protein expression of postsynaptic density (PSD95), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluA1) in the prefrontal cortex was restored by LAT. LAT showed robust anti-inflammatory activity and can lessen the increase in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 caused by CSDS. CSDS altered the gut microbiota at the taxonomic level, resulting in significant changes in \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity. LAT treatment reestablished the bacterial abundance and diversity and increased the production of butyric acid in the gut that was inhibited by CSDS. The levels of butyric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and positively correlated with those of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes across all treatment groups. The current data suggest that, similar to fluoxetine, LAT show antidepressant-like effects in mice exposed to CSDS through the modulation of the gut-brain axis.",

    "abstract": "Daily living and functioning under stress can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Over the past decades, a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between the central nervous system (CNS), intestinal flora and bidirectional communication along the gut brain axis (GBA) in the maintaining of homeostasis. One of the most important factors regulating GBA functioning in exposure to stress may be a proper diet enriched in the supplementation with pre-, pro-and synbiotics. In the present study, we examined whether a 10-week oral preventive supplementation with natural prebiotics: topinambur powder (TPB) and chicory root inulin (INU) influenced an anxiety, depressive behavior and cognition in mice exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Additionally, a fluoxetine (FLU) has been used as a reference antidepressive drug. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of TPB, INU and FLU administration on neurogenesis in mice exposed to CUMS and finally analyzed fecal microbiota for possible changes after TPB and INU supplementation in CUMS induced mice. Results obtained from the behavioral studies (elevated plaze maze, forced swim and Morris water maze test) indicated, that 10 week supplementation with TPB (250 mg/kg) and INU (66 mg/kg), similarly to FLU (12 mg/kg), significantly mitigated an anxiety and stress as well as protected learning and memory functions in the CUMS induced mice compared to the control stressed group. Additionally, TPB and INU CUMS mice showed significantly higher level of neurogenesis in comparison to control CUMS group. Interestingly, results obtained from the fecal microbiota analysis showed a beneficial effect of TPB and INU supplementation against CUMS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that a long-term, preventive supplementation with TPB or INU alleviates the negative effects such as anxiety, cognitive disorders or dysbiosis in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.",

    "abstract": "Opioid-induced dysbiosis (OID) is a specific condition describing the consequences of opioid use on the bacterial composition of the gut. Opioids have been shown to affect the epithelial barrier in the gut and modulate inflammatory pathways, possibly mediating opioid tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia; in combination, these allow the invasion and proliferation of non-native bacterial colonies. There is also evidence that the gut-brain axis is linked to the emotional and cognitive aspects of the brain with intestinal function, which can be a factor that affects mental health. For example, <i>Mycobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> are linked to Irritable Bowel Disease; <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Enterococcacae</i> have associations with Parkinson's disease, and <i>Alistipes</i> has increased prevalence in depression. However, changes to the gut microbiome can be therapeutically influenced with treatments such as faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted antibiotic therapy and probiotics. There is also evidence of emerging therapies to combat OID. This review has collated evidence that shows that there are correlations between OID and depression, Parkinson's Disease, infection, and more. Specifically, in pain management, targeting OID deserves specific investigations.",

    "title": "The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration.",
    "author": "Guy C Brown",
    "journal": "Journal of neuroinflammation",
    "year": "2019",
    "abstract": "The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration is the hypothesis that endotoxin causes or contributes to neurodegeneration. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting much of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, present at high concentrations in gut, gums and skin and in other tissue during bacterial infection. Blood plasma levels of endotoxin are normally low, but are elevated during infections, gut inflammation, gum disease and neurodegenerative disease. Adding endotoxin at such levels to blood of healthy humans induces systemic inflammation and brain microglial activation. Adding high levels of endotoxin to the blood or body of rodents induces microglial activation, priming and/or tolerance, memory deficits and loss of brain synapses and neurons. Endotoxin promotes amyloid \u03b2 and tau aggregation and neuropathology, suggesting the possibility that endotoxin synergises with different aggregable proteins to give different neurodegenerative diseases. Blood and brain endotoxin levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, which is accelerated by systemic infections, including gum disease. Endotoxin binds directly to APOE, and the APOE4 variant both sensitises to endotoxin and predisposes to Alzheimer's disease. Intestinal permeability increases early in Parkinson's disease, and injection of endotoxin into mice induces \u03b1-synuclein production and aggregation, as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The gut microbiome changes in Parkinson's disease, and changing the endotoxin-producing bacterial species can affect the disease in patients and mouse models. Blood endotoxin is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and endotoxin promotes TDP-43 aggregation and neuropathology. Peripheral diseases that elevate blood endotoxin, such as sepsis, AIDS and liver failure, also result in neurodegeneration. Endotoxin directly and indirectly activates microglia that damage neurons via nitric oxide, oxidants and cytokines, and by phagocytosis of synapses and neurons. The endotoxin hypothesis is unproven, but if correct, then neurodegeneration may be reduced by decreasing endotoxin levels or endotoxin-induced neuroinflammation.",
