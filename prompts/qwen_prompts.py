Each text contains:
- Outer tags: <eN> ... </eN> for unique entity IDs

Extract two types of relation triples:

Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relations. Identify which entities types (inner tags labels) are in relation within a document and predict the type of relation between them:

Rules:
1. Extract ONLY relations explicitly stated in text
2. Extract ONLY relations that follow the rules on Defined Relations.
3. "subject_label" and "object_label" must only be the text of the respective inner tag
4. Extract ALL posible relations

    Example:

    You must extract two types of relation triples:

    Task A - Inner Tag-Based Relation Extraction
    - Use Inner tags.

    Task B - Mention-Based Relation Extraction:

    ```json
    "ternary_mention_based_relations": [
